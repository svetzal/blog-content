|-----------------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Design Before Doing: Why TDD Isn't Just About Tests** | [TDD is design activity](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7116388452677341184) • [Developers reduced to typers](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7116388452677341184) • [Tests force design exploration](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7116388452677341184) | Multiple posts explore how TDD is fundamentally a just-in-time design activity, not just a testing methodology. The real power is merging design and implementation so feedback loops become indistinguishable from the main activity. Organizations that reduce developers to "typers of code" miss the design work that separates craft from commodity. |
| **The GenAI Learning Journey: From "Look Ma, It Can Code!" to Strategic Use** | [Moving past the wow phase](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7121484867770408960) • [Drudgery vs artisan work](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7121484867770408960) • [Cost of $1 software](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7121484867770408960) | Explores the maturity curve with GenAI: getting past initial amazement to strategic delegation. Reflects on whether offloading drudgery eliminates learning opportunities that make better artisans. Mike Bowler's quote: "Take out all the thinking and learning, and it only costs $1." Learning organizations must temper bionic enablement. |
| **Symmathesy and Interactionalism: Learning Through Mutual Influence** | [Symmathesy introduction](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7313371709472944128) • [Interactionalism in AI age](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7313371709472944128) • [Nora Bateson's poem](https://norabateson.medium.com/symmathesy-709a39ccb5bc) • [Brain-based learning](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7313371709472944128) | Introduces concepts of symmathesy (living systems that learn through contextual, mutual interaction) and interactionalism (dynamic learning where humans and AI co-evolve). Connects to brain-based learning, Training from the Back of the Room, and the survival skills of learning, unlearning, and relearning. AI as new teammate shifts dynamics and frees us for higher-order thought. |
| **Measure the System, Not the People In It** | [Measure the system](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7114223573258358784) • [Delay in the spaces](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7114223573258358784) | Argues that pointing at people or roles for blame is easy but wrong. 90%+ of delay happens in the space between people—the system in which we've trapped them. Stop looking at individuals, start examining the system. |
| **When AI Becomes the Coach: The Limits of Algorithmic Advice** | [Computational coaching concerns](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7113127961901293569) | Questions the trend toward replacing human coaches with AI advice-givers trained on general data. Reminds us of the power of empathy, context, and human connection that agility was founded on. In low-trust environments, transactional engagement already produces platitudes—we don't need more of that. |
| **The Inexperienced Driver in Too Much Car: Date-Driven Destruction** | [Impatience at the intersection](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7095732870173843456) • [Rational vs irrational behaviors](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7095732870173843456) | Uses driving metaphor to explore irrational date-driven behaviors in software orgs. "Pushing on the gas" with arbitrary deadlines causes collision, not impact. Rational approaches clash with human dynamics. Technicians must learn to navigate emotional, political terrain—the agile community offers tools for this. |
| **Are All Meetings Bad? The Intangibles You Can't Easily Measure** | [Meeting costs vs impact](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7088508652516462592) | Responds to criticism of expensive team gatherings. Not all meetings are wasteful. As a leader, making space for certain meetings requires seeing their impact and knowing how to measure intangibles—which is hard because they're intangibles. Questions the conditions under which eliminating meetings seems like the best idea. |
| **Agile Frameworks Are Just Glasses: What Matters Is What You Pour In** | [Framework is the container](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7047903410125230080) • [You can cram waterfall into Scrum](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7047903410125230080) | Argues that agile frameworks (Scrum, SAFe) are just containers. The properties of the glass don't matter much—what matters is what you fill it with. If people work in isolation and hand off artifacts, you're not agile regardless of framework labels. Behavior > process. |
| **Transformation Starts and Ends With Leadership** | [Leaders are not passive](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7040658272919441408) • [See the org with your own senses](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7040658272919441408) | When leaders say and do things differently, organizations respond accordingly. Leaders aren't passive bystanders by definition. Must clearly see the organization with their own senses, not filtered through others' fears. Change happens through leadership, full stop. |
| **Inclusive Language and Gender: Getting the Details Right** | [Trans Day of Visibility](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6518122979845566464) • [Not to be pitied or tokenized](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6518122979845566464) • [Work to acceptance together](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6518122979845566464) | Personal reflection on Trans Day of Visibility, late-stage transition, privilege intersecting with white middle-class background and unusual career path. Calls for acceptance of agender, genderqueer, polygender identities beyond the binary. "We are not to be pitied. We are not a token. We are simply true." |
| **When Culture Becomes an Entity: The Danger of Abstract Thinking** | [Pinker's "The Blank Slate"](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6292433465702965248) • [Culture through individuals](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6292433465702965248) | Explores Pinker's observation: "When culture is seen as an entity with beliefs and desires, the beliefs and desires of actual people are unimportant." Culture can only be impacted through individuals. "Forced culture" initiatives fail because they treat culture as top-down mandate rather than emergent from individuals and interactions. |
| **Velocity Is a Dangerous Metric** | [Optimizing for metrics is dangerous](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6297036350789021696) • [Velocity misconception](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6297036350789021696) | Critiques velocity as a metric, noting it reinforces the biggest agile misconception: "Agile teams build software faster." This has done tremendous damage. Locally optimizing for efficiency (velocity) ignores systems thinking. You can't optimize for any single metric without side effects. |
| **Blame as Self-Protection: Being Curious About the Protagonist** | [Blame protects self](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7202270004795387905) | Brief but potent observation: blame is how humans protect themselves. Self is the protagonist in everyone's story. When you see blame, be curious about the protagonist—what are they protecting? |
| **Beyond Cooperation: The Shift to True Collaboration** | [Solo to team work](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7196470760016670721) • [Bringing what you know](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7196470760016670721) • [QE role in agile](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7196470760016670721) | Transitioning from solo to team work means shifting from completing tasks to sharing expertise. Collaboration is deeper than cooperation—it's contributing ideas, solving problems collectively, leveraging each other's strengths. Example: QE role isn't redundant in agile; the skills and perspective are more needed than ever. It's not about "doing testing"—it's about applying professional judgment. |
| **No Artifact Suffices: Why We Need Each Other** | [Artifacts are inadequate](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7070377180777598976) • [Agile coach minimizes artifacts](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7070377180777598976) | No artifact—user stories, requirements, diagrams, OKRs—sufficiently communicates what needs to be done. Even collectively, they're inadequate. We want to believe expertise can perfect artifacts, but it's harmful because we can't achieve that perfection. Agile coaching helps people work together so artifacts are minimized, not maximized. |
| **Why Sprints Aren't Magic: Constraints Drive Creativity** | [The sprint is not the goal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6322386160156971008) | When beginning agile transformation, "do sprints" forces you to rethink 9-month processes to fit in two weeks. The sprint isn't magic—it's the constraint that pushes creativity. Rethinking processes to fit constraints is what improves things. The sprint is a step on the journey, not the destination. |
| **Changing Habits Is Hard: Why We Need Coaches** | [Coaching crosses the chasm](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6348257534565969920) | Coaching helps you cross the chasm from intellectual understanding to daily practice. Changing habits is hard—coaches provide the support structure for that transformation. |
| **Binary Thinking and the Rainbow of Reality** | [Polarized thinking](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6212523616356237313) • [Extremes as caricatures](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6212523616356237313) • [See the rainbow](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6212523616356237313) | On the last business day of Pride Month, reflects on binary/black-white/all-or-nothing thinking as a trap. Polarized thinking helps work from extremes to the moderate, but extremes are caricatures. Look at large enterprises: where are feedback paths? How do people reduce risk? Where do they carry peers' concerns? It's never perfect, but kind of beautiful. See the rainbow in work, people, systems. |

## Key Themes and Insights

### **Design Work vs Implementation Work**

A central tension in 2023: organizations persistently reduce developers to "typers of code" rather than designers. TDD emerges not as a testing discipline but as **just-in-time design**—a way to merge thinking and building so tightly that feedback loops become indistinguishable. The tests aren't merely validation; they force exploration of design under evolving constraints. When Stacey writes about developers being "reduced to doing rather than designing," it's a lament for lost craftsmanship and a warning: the value isn't in syntax correctness but in the decisions embedded in code. This connects to broader agile principles—individuals doing meaningful work, not just completing tasks.

### **The GenAI Honeymoon Ends**

Early 2023 posts capture the "look ma, it can code!" phase of GenAI adoption, but skepticism quickly follows. The question isn't whether AI can generate working code—it can—but **what gets lost when thinking and learning are removed from the process**. Mike Bowler's quip about $1 software that strips out all learning resonates throughout the year. Stacey wonders: if we automate the drudgery that built artisan skills, do we create better artisans or just faster executors? The tentative answer: learning organizations must balance automation with deliberate skill-building. AI is a tool, not a substitute for growth.

### **Symmathesy and Co-Learning**

The introduction of **symmathesy**—Nora Bateson's term for living systems that learn through mutual interaction—provides a frame for understanding collaboration in the AI age. Unlike one-directional knowledge transfer, symmathesy emphasizes contextual, reciprocal learning where every participant influences and is influenced. This connects to "interactionalism," an emerging academic framing for AI-augmented education. Stacey sees GenAI as a new teammate that shifts dynamics and frees humans for higher-order thought. The survival skills: learn, unlearn, relearn. We learn best together, and now "together" includes machines.

### **Systems Over Individuals**

Recurring across multiple posts: **blame points at people; improvement requires looking at systems**. It's easy to fault a person or role. It's hard to see the empty space between people where 90%+ of delays actually happen. Whether discussing velocity metrics, meeting costs, or transformation failures, Stacey insists on systems thinking. Locally optimizing (e.g., for velocity) ignores broader dynamics. Measuring people rather than workflows obscures root causes. The advice: measure the system in which people are trapped, not the people themselves.

### **Leadership as Change Agent**

Multiple posts assert that **transformation starts and ends with leadership**. When leaders say and do things differently, organizations respond. Leaders aren't passive—by definition, they shape culture and norms. The challenge: leaders must see the organization with their own senses, not filtered through others' fears or reports. "Forced culture" fails because culture emerges from individuals and interactions, not top-down mandates. Effective leaders create conditions where people can shift behavior, rather than dictating outcomes.

### **Artifacts as Dividers**

A persistent theme: **no artifact suffices**. User stories, architectural diagrams, OKRs—none communicates intent completely. We want to believe perfect documentation exists, but it doesn't. Artifacts divide rather than unite, creating handoff points where understanding degrades. Agile coaching, in this framing, is fundamentally about minimizing reliance on artifacts and maximizing human collaboration. This extends to frameworks themselves—Scrum, SAFe are just "glasses." What matters is the behavior you pour into them, not the container. If work happens in isolation with artifact handoffs, no framework makes it agile.

### **Coaching as Bridge**

Coaching appears repeatedly as the mechanism that **crosses the chasm from intellectual understanding to daily practice**. Changing habits is hard; coaches provide the structure for that transformation. But there's also a warning: replacing human coaches with algorithmic advice (AI chatbots) loses empathy, context, and connection—the very foundations of agility. In low-trust environments already dominated by transactional, superficial engagement, adding more algorithmic platitudes makes things worse. The human element isn't optional—it's the point.

### **Constraints as Catalysts**

The sprint example: **constraints drive creativity**. Being told to "do sprints" isn't magic—it's forcing a rethink of 9-month processes to fit two weeks. The creative work happens when you adapt to the constraint. This principle extends beyond timeboxes: TDD constrains by requiring tests first, pair programming constrains by requiring articulation of thought, even the need to explain decisions to an LLM constrains by demanding clarity. Constraints reveal assumptions and push innovation. They're not limitations—they're levers.

### **Binary Thinking and Complexity**

On Pride Month's last day, Stacey reflects on **binary thinking as a trap**—not just for gender, but for organizations, practices, frameworks. Polarized extremes (agile vs not-agile, good vs bad meetings, TDD fundamentalist vs TDD skeptic) are caricatures. Reality is messy, contextual, rainbow-hued. In large enterprises, look for feedback paths, risk mitigation, where people carry each other's concerns. It's never perfect, but it's often more nuanced than critics or evangelists acknowledge. The wisdom: work from extremes toward the moderate, but don't mistake the caricature for the real.

### **Blame and Self-Protection**

A brief but powerful observation: **blame is self-protection**. Self is the protagonist in everyone's story. When you see blame, be curious—what is that person protecting? This reframes defensiveness from character flaw to human instinct, opening space for compassionate inquiry rather than counter-blame. It's a micro-example of the systems thinking woven throughout 2023: don't judge the individual, understand the context that shaped their response.

### **The Value in Details**

Whether it's inclusive language for trans and non-binary people, precise measurement of systems rather than individuals, or recognizing the difference between cooperation and collaboration, Stacey insists **details matter**. Drag performances at an LGBTQ+ event can alienate trans folks who see their identity caricatured. Velocity as a metric reinforces harmful misconceptions. QE roles aren't redundant—they bring irreplaceable perspective. The broader lesson: surface-level solutions miss the essence. Do the hard work of understanding context, nuance, and unintended consequences.
