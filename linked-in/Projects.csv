Primr (retired),"I began building Primr to support my community outreach work as part of the Gender Journeys programming I help with east of Toronto. It is an intelligent group-messaging system that uses SMS. There is no app to install, no smartphone required, provides cell phone number privacy, and can help reach youth and underprivileged communities like no other technology. Check out the website, or drop me a line to talk about a trial.",https://primr.io,Jan 2015,
