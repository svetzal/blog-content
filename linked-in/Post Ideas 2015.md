| **Building Products That Bridge Digital Divides: Lessons from Primr** | [Nov 23, 2015](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6074578766825345024) - Product launch: Primr SMS community tool<br>[Primr.io](https://primr.io/)<br>[Jul 2, 2015](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6022330947096100865) - Looking for illustrator for manga-style documentation | These posts connect around launching a product that deliberately chose SMS over apps to reach communities where Internet access is limited. The choice to document with comic book/manga panels suggests a human-centered approach to making technology accessible. Worth exploring how technical choices (SMS vs apps) and communication choices (visual storytelling vs traditional docs) both serve inclusion. |
| **Technical Debt Isn't Technical: It's About Decisions We Defer** | [Jul 18, 2015](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6028133753975562240) - Starting a series on reducing technical debt<br>[Dec 22, 2015](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6085100742362873856) - Morning's rant | The technical debt series announcement paired with the end-of-year "rant" suggests frustration with how technical debt accumulates and is discussed. Could explore how technical debt is really about organizational decisions, trade-offs, and the human tendency to optimize for short-term wins. The missing content from the rant post invites speculation about what triggered the reflection. |
| **Green Fields and Fresh Assumptions: What Small Projects Teach Us** | [Jun 4, 2015](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6012284342020165632) - Deep dive into dev work, green-field projects challenging assumptions | This post celebrates small green-field projects as spaces to challenge assumptions and improve approaches. Could explore why starting fresh gives us permission to think differently, how constraints of existing systems inhibit innovation, and what we can bring back from green-field work to legacy systems. |
| **When Tech Takes a Back Seat: The Industry Conversations We Need** | [Jun 30, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN4yLZB1vUQ) - "Wonderful talk, weaving so many important threads... Our industry spends far too much time with its head buried in superfluous tech" | The commentary explicitly critiques the industry's obsession with technology for technology's sake and praises a talk that focuses on "important threads" beyond the technical. Could explore what those threads are (likely human, ethical, societal), why the industry resists these conversations, and what changes when we elevate them. |

## Key Themes and Insights

### **Product Development as Social Justice**

The Primr launch in late 2015 represents a deliberate choice to serve communities marginalized by typical technology assumptions. By choosing SMS—a universal, low-bandwidth medium—over apps, the product acknowledges that "going places apps and the Internet can't" isn't a technical limitation but a design goal. The decision to create manga-style documentation reinforces this: if your product serves diverse communities, your communication should too. This theme suggests a blog exploring how technical choices embed values and either include or exclude users.

### **Technical Debt as Organizational Memory**

The announcement of a technical debt series hints at a deeper inquiry than "how to refactor bad code." Technical debt accumulates because of deferred decisions, competing priorities, and the tension between shipping and crafting. By late 2015, the "morning's rant" suggests accumulated frustration—likely with how technical debt is dismissed, misunderstood, or blamed on developers rather than systems. A post here could reframe technical debt as an artifact of organizational learning (or failure to learn).

### **Green-Field Projects as Creative Laboratories**

Small, green-field projects offer psychological safety to challenge assumptions precisely because they carry no legacy weight. The June post celebrates this freedom explicitly. There's an opportunity to explore why developers need permission to think differently, what assumptions get calcified in production systems, and how to create "green-field thinking" even within constrained environments.

### **The Industry's Superfluous Tech Obsession**

The June 30 post critiques an industry pattern: chasing shiny technology while neglecting "important threads" like ethics, humanity, and impact. The linked talk likely addressed these themes, and the commentary positions it as exceptional precisely because it doesn't. This theme invites a post on what gets lost when we optimize for novelty over substance, and what changes when we center the conversations we've been avoiding.

### **Documentation as Accessibility**

The request for manga-style documentation for Primr isn't just aesthetic—it's strategic. Visual storytelling crosses language barriers, reduces cognitive load, and makes technology approachable for audiences often alienated by traditional technical writing. This connects to the Primr product's mission: if you're building for inclusion, your communication must also be inclusive.

### **Reflection and Iteration**

Across these sparse 2015 posts runs a thread of reflection: challenging assumptions, questioning industry priorities, revisiting technical practices. The green-field work, the technical debt series, the product launch—all suggest a developer who learns by doing and then questions what was done. This meta-theme could anchor a post on how reflection, not just execution, drives growth.

**Note:** 2015 LinkedIn shares are significantly sparser than later years, with several empty or minimal posts. The available material suggests a year focused on product development (Primr), reflection on technical practices (technical debt), and critique of industry culture. The themes above extract maximum insight from limited source material.
