GenAI is no different in that respect, because people are the OG non-deterministic.

Now here's another interesting thing: do you hire your teams to solve problems, or to just follow your instructions? ""Programming by remote control"" is a thing, a costly and slop-building thing. Oh, you thought GenAI was the first approach to develop slop?

There's different kinds of slop, of course. In order of decreasing cost and increased blast radius:

- solving the wrong problem
- solving the problem wrong
 - misunderstanding the technology
 - bad planning
 - bad code

The world runs on bad code that happens to work - eg it solves the right problem well enough. And solving the wrong problem with beautiful code is a special kind of purgatory.","","",MEMBER_NETWORK

You can even give it an image, and it will do its best to generate JSON that is a conceptual representation of what it sees.

This lets you tweak minute parameters while the model faithfully retains everything else you like about the image. Welcome to building design systems!

Isn't it cool how different creative professions (eg visual design, photography, coding, architecture, data) keep intersecting on their underlying creative conceptual models 😀

Folks have been doing something similar for a long time with Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Sora - they intuited their prompts over time as they came to know and leverage the tools, so that their plain language prompts looked more and more structured.

And now we've arrived at formalizing our design language grammars with JSON Schema for a model that is capable of synthesizing what many technologists like me feel like is a mystical realm in which I've never been able to excel.

To be a visual designer now means you're more and more building design languages that make sense in your domain. This skill is more critical than ever. In commercial applications, pretty pictures must fulfil a purpose rather than exist for their own sake. Your role is conceptualizing, clarifying, and modelling to realize that purpose.

Developers can do what they do and push for rigor in fuzzy models so that we can find consistency and digital clarity.

GenAI is rapidly magnifying what we do within our professions, continues to prove it doesn't replace us, just gives us different and in many ways more powerful tools, but most importantly, it's pushing us to re-imagine how we do things.

Of course if you mean literally, it's obviously wrong. But I know compilers. And CPU instruction sets. And there's always been a march towards non-determinism even within those technologies, long before generative AI. You don't know how your code is going to get pipelined on a CPU. You don't know how the optimizer is going to adjust the machine or intermediate code generated. This pushed us to higher order languages and even introduced the notion of a compiler.

_What_ is deterministic is always shifting. Because life isn't deterministic.
People demand determinism from IT constantly, and we try and build deterministic or idempotent systems on top of chaos.

For me, what it is forcing me to reassess is the new lines between determinism and non-determinism. Frankly, this is a problem that developers have always had to solve for.

A compiler wasn't just a fancy assembler. And the implications of generative AI aren't just a fancy compiler.","","",MEMBER_NETWORK

For example, I have a library, mojentic, which provides simplified LLM and agentic plumbing for developers looking to add those features to their apps. Originally the library was built in Python, the language I typically use when exploring data-science technologies, plus it's a good general purpose language.

The library currently spans Python, Rust, Elixir and Typescript.

I have a multifaceted design philosophy with the library. I want the same use-cases supported across all libraries, but I want idiomatic structures that make each library ""comfortable"" to its own developer community. Functional, Object Oriented, Strongly typed, Weakly typed, these all have an impact on what the best ""code design"" to fit the use-cases might be, and leads to localized design decisions that differ between the libraries.

They have the same high-level quality guidelines. Linting, testing, dependency security, documentation, and build automation.

The monorepo-like approach with submodules lets me keep the individual libraries and their build automation independent, while providing higher-order policy, use-case, and intent guidelines common between all libraries.

Experience opening agentic tools like Claude Code, Codex CLI, Github Copilot, Windsurf, etc is varied. Windsurf doesn't do particularly great because it tends to want a singular technology analysis for a ""project"". Copilot isn't as bad, but can't handle nested guidance (eg copilot instructions in individual repos scoped around those concerns, versus instructions in the higher order folders scoped around the broader concerns.)

Agentic tools that respect nested AGENTS.md or Claude Code with its nestable CLAUDE.md seem to handle things best.

This has let me explore some interesting things.

- a daily process that runs claude automatically to perform a dependency security sweep, and coordinate new automated releases of impacted libraries
- adding a use-case to the executive documentation and letting specialized sub-agents ripple the implications throughout each submodule
- bringing technical capabilities and documentation standards in sync - eg each library, while using very different but locally standardized technologies (eg MkDocs for python, ExDoc for elixir, mdBook/rustdoc for Rust, VitePress for Typescript)
- the ability to accommodate variability and commonality in different directions automatically is a brand new, very agentic approach to managing software projects
- it has enabled me to avoid shoe-horning in awkward technology or policy mixes... eg:
 - why use MkDocs for elixir when ExDoc is there and well known / recognizable by the elixir community, and better integrated with elixir code
 - avoid leaking OO design concepts into functional code

I'm porting my mojentic library to Rust and Elixir, and pointed out that it needed to better frame the capabilities of Elixir. Here was its response:

Perfect! I've reframed the ""Type System"" row as ""Data Modeling"" and added a comprehensive section explaining the philosophical differences between the three approaches. The key insights:

Python (Pydantic): Runtime validation - ""trust but verify""
- Rich validation logic at runtime
- Flexible but with overhead

Elixir (Pattern Matching): ""Thinking in data""
- Data flows through transformations
- Pattern matching IS the validation
- Shape emerges from use, not declaration
- ""Let it crash"" philosophy
- Implicit contracts through function signatures

Rust (Type System): Compile-time guarantees
- ""Make invalid states unrepresentable""
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Caught at compile time

The section emphasizes that Elixir's approach isn't about weak typing - it's about a fundamentally different philosophy where:

- Data is separate from behavior
- Pattern matching validates through usage
- Pipelines transform data
- Function signatures define implicit contracts

This captures the essence of ""thinking in data"" - you don't validate against schemas, you match on the shapes you need and let unmatched patterns fail naturally. The structure of your data drives the control flow of your program.","","",MEMBER_NETWORK

""Artificial intelligence is a common misnomer in the software field today  - professionals call this emerging interest ""machine learning"" because there is no real intelligence behind it. It blatantly inherits, and worse can magnify the systemic oppressions inherent in how it is designed. The software field is suffering a diversity crisis, small monocultures have tremendous impact on how we interact with the world through technology, and the effects it has on everything from the digital representations of our personhood in cyberspace and therefore how we are perceived by others, to how our own memories are impacted by algorithms that seek to remind or raise attention to a similarly distorted view of our past. I tend to recommend two talks by Corina Zona to developers to raise their awareness here, ""Schémas for the Real World"" discusses how we codify oppression in our databases, and ""Consequences of an Insightful Algorithm"" discusses examples of how naive algorithms at our favourite Internet companies are violating privacy and further oppressing people in the world around us, often without our direct knowledge.","","",MEMBER_NETWORK
