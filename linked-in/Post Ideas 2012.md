|-----------------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Why I'll Never Install an OS on Bare Metal Again: The Virtualization Revolution** | [July 18, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1269080473) - Love for server virtualization, saving old servers from hardware failure<br>[Oct 12, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1309882583) - VCentre Server storage migration | These posts celebrate the practical liberation that virtualization brought to infrastructure management. They connect the joy of elegant solutions with the relief of avoiding hardware dependencies. Could explore how virtualization changed the developer's relationship with infrastructure, making it software-defined and therefore more malleable, testable, and recoverable. |
| **Building for the Real World: When Mobile Meets Physical Computing** | [Dec 11, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1341341553) - Mobile framework building on Raspberry Pi, connecting business workflow to the real world | This post hints at the convergence of mobile development and IoT before IoT was mainstream. The excitement about building frameworks that bridge digital business processes with physical world interactions reflects early thinking about ubiquitous computing. Could examine how we were already seeing the limitations of purely digital solutions. |
| **The iOS Enterprise Dilemma: When Consumer Tech Meets Business Needs** | [Oct 10, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1308297457) - Apple Configurator for managing business iOS devices<br>[Dec 7, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1339098457) - Android becoming business-friendly | These shares capture the tension of the BYOD era—consumer devices flooding into enterprises. The enthusiasm for management tools reflects the pragmatic challenge: how do we embrace these powerful tools without chaos? Could explore the balance between user delight and organizational control. |
| **Finding Your Tribe: What Software Craftsmanship Conferences Taught Me About Community** | [Nov 9, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1324250834) - Early start at SCNA conference<br>[Nov 11, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1325008200) - SCNA wrap-up, meeting amazing people, code retreat<br>[Dec 5, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1337619463) - BDD/testing interview with Liz Keogh ([link](http://ow.ly/fPsgc)) | The genuine excitement about meeting people and learning at SCNA reveals how isolated developers can feel. These posts aren't about the technical content—they're about connection, shared values, and finding others who care about craft. Could reflect on why conferences matter more for community than content. |
| **Growing a Craft-Focused Consultancy: What We Look For When We Hire** | [Aug 16, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1282026714) - Looking for 2 developers interested in advancing their craft<br>[Oct 9, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1308013372) - Welcoming intern Graham Corke<br>[Aug 29, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1287944507) - Agile Toronto East tooling talk ([link](http://lnkd.in/3CpUuM)) | These posts reveal what mattered when building a team: not just skills, but craft and learning. The phrase "advancing their craft" is key—it's not about filling roles but about growing people. The mix of hiring, mentoring interns, and sharing knowledge at meetups shows an integrated approach to building capability. |
| **When the Internet Needs Defending: Why Developers Should Care About Policy** | [Mar 10, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3AgroupPost%3A3569995-100222973) - Bill C-11 and SOPA-style amendments threatening social media and the Internet in Canada | This standalone post reveals a civic consciousness that developers sometimes lack. It's easy to stay heads-down in code, but when the platform itself—the Internet—is under threat, silence is complicity. Could explore when and why developers need to engage with policy and advocacy. |
| **The Hidden Costs of Free: When Google Apps Changes Break Startups** | [Dec 7, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1339207565) - Google Apps changes affecting early-stage startups ([link](http://ow.ly/fUlnL)) | A cautionary observation about dependency on free/cheap platforms. Startups optimize for now, but platform changes can force expensive pivots. Could explore the hidden costs of "free" and how to evaluate platform risk in early-stage ventures. |

## Key Themes and Insights

### **Infrastructure as Liberation, Not Burden**

The 2012 posts about virtualization aren't technical showing-off—they're relief and joy at escaping the tyranny of physical hardware. When you can snapshot, clone, migrate, and recover servers like they're files, infrastructure stops being the thing that breaks your flow and becomes part of your flow. This was peak "infrastructure as code" thinking before we called it that. The lesson: when we can treat infrastructure as software, we gain agility. But more importantly, we reclaim our time and attention for problems that matter.

### **Craft, Community, and Growing Others**

Multiple posts reveal a philosophy: software development as craft, teams as communities of practice, and hiring as an invitation to learn together. The SCNA conference posts capture genuine excitement about *people*, not talks. The job posting doesn't ask for "senior developers"—it asks for people interested in advancing their craft. This reflects a belief that growth mindset matters more than current skill. Blogging this theme could explore what it means to build organizations around learning rather than credentials.

### **Bridging Digital and Physical: The Persistent Dream**

The Raspberry Pi + mobile framework post is easy to overlook, but it hints at recurring tension in software: the digital is never enough. We keep reaching toward the physical—sensors, actuators, IoT, wearables. In 2012, this was still niche. Today it's everywhere, but the fundamental challenge remains: how do you build systems that gracefully cross the digital-physical boundary? A post could examine why we keep returning to this problem and what makes it so hard.

### **The BYOD Dilemma: Control vs. Delight**

The mobile device management posts sit at the collision of two forces: users want delightful consumer tech, and organizations want control and security. The enthusiasm for Apple Configurator and Android's business features isn't about loving MDM—it's about finding a path through the tension. This remains unresolved: how do we give people tools they love without descending into chaos? A deeper exploration could ask whether "control" is even the right frame.

### **Developers and Civic Responsibility**

The Bill C-11 post stands alone, but it's important. Developers build the infrastructure of modern life, yet often stay out of policy debates. This post argues otherwise: when legislation threatens the open Internet, developers have both expertise and obligation to speak up. Could explore what civic engagement looks like for developers and why staying "apolitical" is itself a political choice.

### **Platform Risk and the Illusion of Free**

The Google Apps observation is a microcosm of a larger problem: dependency on platforms you don't control. Startups optimize for speed and cost, often by building on free/cheap platforms. But platforms change, and changes can be existential. This connects to broader themes of vendor lock-in, open source, and resilience. A post could examine how to evaluate platform risk and when to pay for independence.

---

**Meta-observation**: These 2012 posts reflect someone running a small, craft-focused consultancy, deeply engaged with both technical excellence and community building. The themes cluster around liberation (from hardware, from silos), connection (conferences, hiring, teaching), and responsibility (to craft, to the open internet). The tone is optimistic but not naive—aware of tensions and trade-offs, not offering easy answers.
