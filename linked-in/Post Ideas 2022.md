## Proposed Blog Posts

| Proposed blog post (working title) | Source material & URLs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **"The Real Work: Beyond Getting Things Done"** | • [2022-03-19] "When we say, 'getting the work done', what is 'the work'?" <br/>• [2022-03-19] Draft article about working together | These posts question what "work" actually means in software development. The theme connects to a deeper inquiry about whether we're focusing on the right activities—typing code versus solving problems, shipping features versus creating value. Could explore the invisible work of thinking, learning, collaborating, and understanding that gets dismissed as "not real work." |
| **"Controlling Complexity: Your Code's Eternal Battle"** | • [2022-10-27] "Control complexity or complexity will control you. The chaos naturally creeps in, you can't stop it. You're writing code to solve a shifting problem, in a shifting team, in a language that's a work-in-progress, using frameworks that are a work-in-progress, in an editor that's a work-in-progress, on an operating system that's a work-in-progress, on a computer that you're likely to replace within a couple of years. You are a leaf on the wind. Every keystroke you make must tame the chaos." | A powerful meditation on the inevitability of complexity in software development. Connects the technical reality (shifting tools, languages, frameworks) with the human reality (shifting teams, evolving problems). The "leaf on the wind" metaphor is evocative—we're not in control of the forces around us, but we must respond deliberately with each decision we make. Could explore practical strategies for managing complexity, the cost of complexity, and how teams can build resilience against entropy. |
| **"From Doing to Knowing: The Career Path No One Talks About"** | • [2022-11-24] "I realize we might have more folks on the hunt for their next opportunity around here. I have open Agile Technical Practice coach positions..." <br/>• [2022-10-23] "If you've had a great career building software systems, and want to stretch yourself from doing to helping others do, you might consider a career as an Agile Technical Practices Coach. The stretch isn't for everyone, I found the biggest challenge in the stretch was trying to hold myself back from doing it for them. I used to do the heroics, and I'm still the hero on my personal projects, but seeing the impact beyond code I wrote is incredibly rewarding. As a sub-discipline of agile coaching, technical practices coaching also has a high degree of mentoring, teaching about boundaries, emergent design, using code to communicate with and beyond your teammates, building lean systems that can adapt to many tomorrows and all of the things you've learned through a career of getting good software to market sooner." | These posts describe a career transition from individual contributor to coach/mentor. The tension: the urge to "do it for them" versus helping them do it themselves. Could explore the identity shift, the skills needed beyond technical expertise, the reward of multiplying impact through others, and why some senior developers resist this path. The phrase "seeing the impact beyond code I wrote" captures the essence of leadership. |
| **"Objectives That Unlock Creativity: Why Your OKRs Might Be Holding You Back"** | • [2022-08-14] "Are the objectives in your OKRs just your own solutions to the real challenge? Worthy objectives activate creative thinking and learning in your organization. Don't limit folks by giving them your answer." | A critique of how OKRs are often implemented—as disguised solutions rather than true objectives. The insight: when leaders embed their solutions into objectives, they rob teams of the opportunity to think creatively. Could explore the difference between constraint and prescription, how to write objectives that enable rather than constrain, and why organizations struggle to trust teams with real problems rather than pre-digested answers. |
| **"Patterns as Language: What We Learn from Introspection and Retrospection"** | • [2022-07-10] "I just wanted to amplify what my friend Danica has to say in this post... I think patterns are an important outcome of both our introspection but especially our retrospection, and I'm always looking for the underlying language of patterns when folks fall into big up front plans instead of iterative agile plans." | This post connects patterns to reflection practices. The tension: people default to big upfront plans because they don't have a language of patterns to work with. Could explore how patterns emerge from repeated practice and reflection, why pattern recognition is a learned skill, how retrospectives build organizational pattern literacy, and the relationship between agility and pattern fluency. |

## Key Themes and Insights

### **The Invisible Architecture of "Work"**

In 2022, Stacey was clearly wrestling with what constitutes meaningful work in software development. The question "what is 'the work'?" appears almost existential—if we're not careful, we reduce work to visible output (code shipped, tickets closed) and miss the thinking, learning, and relating that actually produces quality outcomes. This connects to a broader tension in the industry around productivity metrics and the pressure to measure everything, often to the detriment of the very work we're trying to improve.

### **Complexity as the Adversary**

The October post on complexity reads like a manifesto. Every element of the software development stack is unstable, in flux, evolving. The developer is "a leaf on the wind" amid these forces. The insight isn't defeatist—it's a call to arms: "Every keystroke you make must tame the chaos." This is deeply pragmatic. Complexity isn't something we solve once; it's something we wrestle with constantly. The best we can do is be intentional, deliberate, and disciplined in how we fight back.

### **The Shift from Hero to Guide**

The posts about technical coaching describe a profound career transition. It's not just a change in job title—it's a change in identity. The "heroic" individual contributor who swoops in to save the day must learn to step back, to resist the urge to do it themselves, and to find satisfaction in someone else's success. This is leadership in its truest form: multiplying impact through others. The phrase "impact beyond code I wrote" is the thesis statement for this career arc.

### **Objectives vs. Solutions**

The OKR post is a subtle but critical critique. Organizations often claim they want outcomes-focused work, but then they hand teams objectives that are really just solutions in disguise. "Build a mobile app" isn't an objective; it's a solution to some unstated problem. Real objectives activate creativity because they describe a desired state without prescribing the path. This connects to a broader theme in Stacey's work: trust. Trust that teams, given real problems and context, will find better solutions than any single leader could prescribe.

### **Patterns as Organizational Memory**

The post on patterns hints at something deeper: patterns are how we encode learning. They're the language through which we communicate what we've discovered. When teams default to big upfront planning, it's often because they don't yet have a shared pattern language to draw from. They haven't done the work (individually or collectively) of reflecting on what worked, what didn't, and why. Retrospection and introspection aren't feel-good rituals—they're how organizations build the memory and fluency that enables agility.

### **Community and Craft**

Throughout 2022, there are multiple references to Agile Coach Camp Canada, Play4Agile, and other community events. These aren't peripheral—they're central to how Stacey understands professional growth. We learn best in community, through play, through safe spaces to experiment and fail. The coaching practice Stacey describes isn't just about one-on-one mentoring; it's about building cultures where people can surface their learning edges, take risks, and grow together.
