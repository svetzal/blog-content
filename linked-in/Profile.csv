💡 Stacey,Vetzal,,,"May 1, 2016",Collaborate for better outcomes. Share insights instead of to-do lists.,"**Engineering leader and builder of high-performing cultures.**    I bring deep technical credibility and over two decades of coaching experience to engineering leadership. I’ve spent 45 years writing code across a wide array of languages and environments — because to lead developers well, you need to understand their craft from the inside out.    I’ve helped organizations transform how they build software through hands-on coaching, architecture, and culture work. At Sallie Mae, I launched Dojo and Code Clinic programs, introduced Specification by Example, ATDD, and TDD practices, and helped integrate dozens of quality-focused developers across 35 teams. At Sherwin Williams, Rogers, Web Canada, and 360 Insights, I coached teams through architectural modernization and cultural change that endured long after my engagement.    From 2015–2021, I founded and led Coding Culture, a coaching practice focused on healthy software development culture — the idea that teams perform best when technical excellence and human systems evolve together. That belief continues to shape my work.    At RBC, I built and led the Digital Agile Coaching Practice, growing it to 22 coaches supporting 10 business areas. More recently, I’ve moved closer to engineering again — building and deploying agentic AI automation to help developers work more effectively at scale, and training teams on how to integrate generative AI into real-world delivery workflows (or, as I like to say, helping people figure out what the hell to do with all these new tools that keep showing up).    I’ve watched the software industry reinvent itself — desktop, web, mobile, cloud — and now AI is reshaping how we think about code, design, and collaboration. This might be the biggest shift yet, and I’m here for it.    Outside of work, I’ve launched the Durham IT Association, led Ladies Learning Code Durham to improve gender equity in tech, and supported the transgender community through Gender Journeys and PFLAG Canada Durham Region.",Software Development,K0L3C0,"Wilberforce, Ontario, Canada",[svetzal],"[BLOG:https://stacey.vetzal.com,PORTFOLIO:https://github.com/svetzal]",
