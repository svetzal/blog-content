|---|---|---|
| **The Glass and What Fills It: Frameworks vs. Behavior in Agile Transformation** | [2017-04-01 Framework is a glass post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6262622548933042176)<br/>[2017-03-20 Leaders and transformation](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6249206477051949056)<br/>[2017-05-16 Agile framework reveals problems](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6262891157489184768) | The metaphor of frameworks as containers is powerful—they reveal problems but don't fix them. These shares explore how organizations focus on the container (Scrum, SAFe) while missing what matters: the human behaviors, collaboration patterns, and continuous improvement that fill the glass. Connects waterfall-in-Scrum-clothing to the real work of transformation. |
| **Stop Asking Developers to Guess: The Estimation Paradox** | [2017-08-20 Software dev estimation ability](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6305033503398457344)<br/>[2017-08-20 Estimation reflects adaptability](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6305035596354527232)<br/>[2017-08-20 Estimation vs innovation](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6305118278129844224)<br/>[2007 post on estimates](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6305035596354527232) | A cluster of shares on the same day reveals frustration with estimation demands. The core insight: developers can only estimate what they've done before, but software development requires constant adaptation to new contexts, tools, and problems. Forcing repeatability trades innovation for false certainty. Could explore the tension between business need for predictability and developer need to respond to change. |
| **DevOps as Human Liberation: Automating the Demeaning** | [2017-03-20 DevOps human values](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6249547743220506624)<br/>[2017-08-29 DevOps strategy rewarding](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6308269041702174720)<br/>[2017-10-25 DevOps centers on config as code](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6328878409527095296)<br/>[2017-12-28 DevOps reveals sloppy practices](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6352125966403272704) | These shares frame DevOps not as a technical practice but as a humanistic one—"our responsibility to automate the unimaginative and uninteresting things, those things which to do would demean us as human beings." Explores DevOps as both revelatory (exposing poor practices) and liberating (creating weightless paths to production). |
| **Code is Communication: What We Miss When We Focus on Typing** | [2017-11-05 Writing code is least helpful activity](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6332986652826300416)<br/>[2017-08-14 Teaching tech promotes tight coupling](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6314367625318002688)<br/>[2017-07-28 Coding Culture program](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6296677954483159041)<br/>[2017-09-23 Teaching coupling in tech](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6317453204351180800) | "Writing code is a software developer's least helpful activity"—a provocative statement that invites exploration of what developers actually do: make decisions, reason about problems, communicate through code. Connects to how we teach (promoting tight coupling) versus what we need (thoughtful design). |
| **The Constraint is the Point: Why Sprints Force Better Thinking** | [2017-10-07 Sprints as creative constraint](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6322386160156971008)<br/>[2017-08-27 Create environment to abort sprints](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6307560301143302144) | Explores how artificial constraints (like sprints) aren't magical solutions but forcing functions for creativity. The sprint isn't the goal—it's the constraint that pushes you to rethink processes. Also touches on psychological safety: giving teams the power to "stop the line" when problems emerge. |
| **Craftsmanship as Continuous Becoming: The Dreyfus Model in Practice** | [2017-09-02 Agile Technical Practices post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6309770924266651648)<br/>[2017-01-07 Always learning to program](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6223506639987761152)<br/>[2017-08-19 Developer seeking out warm approach](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6304624885939339264)<br/>[Series of "Signs of Software Craftsmanship" posts Sept 2017](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6331060880519757824) | Multiple shares about learning journeys, the Dreyfus model, and the "Signs of Software Craftsmanship" campaign. Core theme: development isn't about reaching mastery, it's about perpetual growth. "I've been learning to program since I was 10... 36 years and counting." Could explore stages of expertise, teaching approaches, and the tension between knowing rules and knowing when to break them. |
| **Empathy Can't Be Digitized: What Developers Bring Beyond Code** | [2017-08-11 Empathy and feelings in dev](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6302094847494885376)<br/>[2017-08-20 Developers as designers](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6305014886057414656)<br/>[2017-06-03 No artifacts are sufficient](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6270377180777598976) | Tackles the reducing of development to "typing code" and what's actually valuable—empathy, design thinking, human connection. "No artifact we produce... is sufficient to communicate what needs to be done." Connects to discussions of "Robots and Zombies" talk on feelings, and why collaboration can't be replaced by specs. |
| **Quality Can't Be Inspected In: Fast Feedback Over Perfect Pipelines** | [2017-08-08 DevOps and quality](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6332927066395602944)<br/>[2017-06-17 Developers and bugs](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6414123447449841664)<br/>[2017-09-20 Teaching testers in agile](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6316216347386744832) | DevOps pipelines are about feedback speed, not perfection. Quality comes from the work, not from inspection. Explores teaching quality practices (to testers, to teams) in agile contexts and the cultural shift from gatekeeping to collaborative quality. |
| **The Courage to Change: Overcoming Fear in Code** | [2017-09-14 Afraid to change code](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6344843977291763712)<br/>[2017-09-09 Handling change with grace](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6318808111847133185)<br/>[2017-08-16 Courage topics and feelings talk](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6172722037753212928) | "If you are afraid to change your code, you're doing it wrong." Multiple references to courage, feelings, and the "Robots and Zombies" talk. Explores psychological barriers to refactoring and how technical practices (TDD, pairing) build safety and courage. |
| **Test-Driven Thinking: Design Over Validation** | [2017-10-07 TDD myths](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6323993309901293569)<br/>[2017-09-18 Signs: how it's done matters](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6918450956185399296)<br/>[2017-09-15 Writing tests because told vs. quickly](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6917333584322011136) | TDD misunderstood as being "about the tests"—really about just-in-time design. "The tests force us to explore our designs." Connects testing-as-gating to testing-as-design-tool. Could address common misconceptions and why TDD feels awkward to those focused on validation over design. |
| **Visible Like Windows: What Transparency Actually Means** | [2017-02-01 Visibility metaphor](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6364851700578291712)<br/>[2017-07-06 Theory of Constraints thinking](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6288713212930113536) | "When we build cars we don't make a window where you can see the engine... We make a window to see the road ahead." What should transparency look like in software? Connects to TOC thinking: visibility should show us where we're going and where the constraints are, not just the mechanics. |
| **Distance is Destiny: Why Teams Must Stay Close to Customers** | [2017-08-17 "Why do this?" as correct response](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6305395857965486080)<br/>[2017-08-21 Team agreements](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6305395857965486080)<br/>[2017-07-10 Minimizing artifacts](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6290199851313491968) | Explores the "distance between developers and customers" as an early indicator of responsiveness. Developers asking "Why do this?" instead of "How long?" shows they're engaged with purpose, not just execution. Teams are defined by agreements, not proximity. |
| **When Words Fail Us: On Precision and Human Connection** | [2017-04-20 Communicating post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6297036350789021696)<br/>[2017-04-20 Supercommunicators book](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6187397624755335169)<br/>[2017-07-16 Culture through individuals](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6292433465702965248) | Personal reflection on the struggle to communicate: understanding machines (precise, debuggable) versus understanding people (ambiguous, contextual). Reading Supercommunicators as a developer who craves precision. Culture lives in individuals, not abstractions. |
| **Complexity Will Control You: The Creeping Chaos in Code** | [2017-10-27 Control complexity](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6991529690515521537)<br/>[2017-08-02 Stinky code blindness](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6298464885227474944) | "Control complexity or complexity will control you. The chaos naturally creeps in, you can't stop it." Explores how environmental flux (changing languages, frameworks, tools) makes every keystroke a battle against entropy. Developers become nose-blind to code smells when surrounded by them constantly. |
| **The Lizard Brain Codes: Why Kata Practice Matters** | [2017-04-15 Teach Lizard Brain to code](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6126698527771983872)<br/>[2017-05-13 Gilded Rose kata practice](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6269891157489184768)<br/>[2017-08-14 Gilded Rose kata starter](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6302977752391786496) | Practice (kata) helps developers build muscle memory so that when things go wrong, instinct kicks in with less damage. References to specific kata work (Gilded Rose) and building practice environments. Could explore deliberate practice, System 1 vs System 2 thinking (Kahneman), and why repetition matters. |
| **Polarized Thinking and the Rainbow of Work** | [2017-06-28 Pride and polarized thinking](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6212523616356237313)<br/>[2017-10-31 Internal compass as leader](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6331060880519757824)<br/>[2017-10-29 Targeting women with skincare](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6330338030448050176) | Written on the last day of Pride month: "Binary, black and white, or all-or-nothing thinking is a trap... see the rainbow in our work." Touches on leadership compass, avoiding noise/distractions, and systemic biases (like LinkedIn serving skincare ads to professional women). |
| **Microservices and the Illusion of the Next Silver Bullet** | [2017-03-29 Microservices warning](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6517363718362329088) | "Humans, we feel so much that we missed the sale price... The price of loose coupling sits in our blind spot of hope." Warning against rushing into microservices without understanding the complexity cost. "It is yet another cold and unforgiving computational approach, no warmer or friendlier than the last." |
| **Blame as Self-Protection: Getting Curious About the Protagonist** | [2017-05-31 Blame and self](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7202270004795387905)<br/>[2017-07-25 Ladder of Inference](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6294968693873004544) | "Blame is a way to protect self. When you see blame, be curious about the protagonist." Explores human patterns of self-protection, connects to Ladder of Inference (easy to slide down into assumptions). Short but potent insights into team dynamics. |

## Key Themes and Insights

### **Agile as Behavior, Not Ceremony**

Throughout 2017, a consistent frustration emerges: organizations adopting frameworks (Scrum, SAFe) while missing the behavioral and cultural shifts that matter. The "glass and what fills it" metaphor captures this perfectly—frameworks are containers that reveal problems, but the real transformation happens in how people collaborate, how they handle failure, and whether they can adapt. The waterfall-in-Scrum problem persists because we focus on artifacts (user stories, sprint ceremonies) instead of on closing the distance between people doing the work and people using it.

### **Estimation as a Symptom of Misunderstanding**

Multiple passionate shares on August 20, 2017 reveal a deep frustration with estimation demands. The core tension: businesses want predictability, but software development is fundamentally about responding to change and novelty. Developers can only estimate what they've already done, which means optimizing for estimability means sacrificing innovation and adaptability. This isn't a developer problem to solve—it's a systems problem about how we think about planning, risk, and value.

### **DevOps as Liberation, Not Automation**

DevOps isn't presented as a technical practice but as a humanistic one—freeing people from "the unimaginative and uninteresting things, those things which to do would demean us as human beings." It's simultaneously revelatory (exposing sloppy practices that were hidden in manual processes) and liberating (creating frictionless paths to production). The technical practices matter, but they're in service of human dignity and capability.

### **Code is Communication, Not Output**

A recurring theme: what developers actually do—reason, design, make decisions, communicate intent—gets obscured when we reduce the work to "typing code." The least helpful thing a developer can do is write code; the most helpful things are invisible: understanding context, making design choices, revealing intent through structure. This connects to how we teach (often promoting tight coupling and copy-paste) versus what expert developers actually practice.

### **Constraints as Creative Forces**

Sprints, TDD, DevOps pipelines—these aren't prescriptive solutions but productive constraints. The value isn't in following the process; it's in what the constraint forces you to confront. A sprint forces you to break down work differently. TDD forces you to confront design decisions earlier. The constraint is the point, not the outcome.

### **Craftsmanship as Continuous Becoming**

Learning never stops. Multiple references to the Dreyfus model, the evolution from Apprentice to Journeyman to Craftsman, and the humility that comes with expertise ("if your answer to every question is 'it depends,' you may have achieved Craftsman"). The "Signs of Software Craftsmanship" campaign captures stages of growth: writing tests because you were told to (Apprentice) versus writing tests to code quickly (Craftsman).

### **Empathy Can't Be Digitized**

What makes a great developer isn't typing speed or algorithm knowledge—it's empathy, context sensitivity, and the ability to hold both the user's pain and the system's complexity simultaneously. "No artifact we produce... is sufficient." This is why automation threatens to commoditize output while missing what actually creates value: human understanding, connection, and design thinking.

### **Courage and Safety in Code**

"If you are afraid to change your code, you're doing it wrong." Technical practices (TDD, pairing, refactoring) aren't about productivity—they're about building psychological safety and courage. The ability to change code without fear is foundational to agility. Multiple references to a "Robots and Zombies" talk on feelings suggest an emerging thread about emotional/psychological dimensions of technical work.

### **Testing as Design, Not Validation**

TDD is persistently misunderstood as "about the tests" when it's really about design. Writing tests forces exploration of design constraints in real time. The value extends far beyond validation—tests become specification, documentation, and design feedback loop. Writing tests "because you were told to" versus "so that you can code quickly" marks a fundamental shift in understanding.

### **Complexity as the Enemy**

"Control complexity or complexity will control you." Entropy is inevitable in software—changing frameworks, languages, tools, teams. Every keystroke is a battle to tame chaos. Developers become nose-blind to code smells when surrounded by them daily. The work isn't to eliminate complexity but to continuously push back against its natural accumulation.

### **Distance as Dysfunction**

The "distance between developers and customers" is an early indicator of organizational health. When developers ask "Why do this?" instead of "How long?", they're engaged with purpose. When teams are defined by agreements rather than co-location, they're actually collaborative. Artifacts (requirements, designs, specifications) are where distance hides—they create the illusion of communication while enabling silos.

### **The Human Dimension of Leadership**

Leaders aren't passive. Their internal compass matters more than external noise. Blame is self-protection—get curious about the protagonist. Culture lives in individuals, not platitudes. Transformation requires leaders to see the organization with their own senses, not filtered through fear or secondhand reports.

### **Practice and Muscle Memory**

Kata practice, deliberate repetition—these build the "lizard brain" responses that prevent damage when things go wrong. System 1 thinking (fast, instinctive) versus System 2 (slow, deliberate) means that under stress, we default to what we've practiced. If we haven't practiced good habits, we'll execute bad ones flawlessly.

### **Inclusion as Professionalism**

Touches on diversity, representation, and how systems encode biases. Drag performances at "LGBTQ+ inclusion" events can alienate trans folks. LinkedIn serving skincare ads to professional women reveals systemic misogyny. Being visible matters. Pride isn't just a celebration—it's a call to see the rainbow in work and people, to resist binary thinking.

### **The Silver Bullet Fallacy**

Microservices, new frameworks, new languages—we keep hoping the next thing will solve our problems. "It is yet another cold and unforgiving computational approach, no warmer or friendlier than the last." The problem isn't the tools; it's that we rush into them without understanding the complexity cost, blinded by the fear of missing out.

**Analysis approach:** These themes emerged from examining the full corpus of 2017 shares, looking for recurring language, connected ideas, and points of emphasis. The strongest themes received multiple related shares; others appeared in single powerful statements. The goal was to cluster conceptually rather than chronologically, identifying the intellectual through-lines that could become compelling blog posts in Stacey's voice—technical yet human, practical yet philosophical, always grounded in real experience.
