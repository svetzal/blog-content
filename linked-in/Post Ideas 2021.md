| **The Agile Coach's Real Job: Beyond the Framework** | [Dec 7, 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6873788231155007488) - Hiring agile technical coaches<br>[Oct 9, 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A6852598419450597376) - Jake's recommendation | Multiple posts reflect on what agile coaching truly entails - not teaching frameworks but helping people work together differently. The focus is on technical practices coaching as a specialized discipline that requires deep software engineering experience combined with the ability to mentor rather than do the work yourself. |
| **The Map Is Not The Territory: Why AI Won't Replace Developers** | [Sept 29, 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6849124899018063872) - AgileTO talk link (https://youtu.be/CJ_hv8JWS3g)<br>[Multiple 2021 posts] - References to feelings, humanity in development | A thread emerges about what can't be digitized - empathy, feeling, human connection. Software development isn't just typing code with correct syntax. The real differentiator is the tacit knowledge, the feelings that guide experienced developers, the ability to empathize with users and create delightful experiences. |
| **Nobody Cares About Your Agile Framework** | [Feb 22, 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6769711524593364992) - Post about Amplify event<br>[Feb 4, 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6763203293033357313) - Being part of coaching initiative | The posts suggest that frameworks (Scrum, SAFe, etc.) are just containers - what matters is what you fill them with. The emphasis is on how people actually behave within the framework, whether they collaborate or work in isolation, whether they iterate or just rebrand their waterfall. The framework doesn't fix anything; it only reveals problems. |
| **Software Estimates: Stop Making Developers Guess at the Future** | Several implicit references to estimation challenges throughout coaching discussions | The tension around estimates appears repeatedly - developers can only estimate based on having done something before, under specific conditions that will never be exactly repeated. The pace of change in software means those conditions are always shifting. Rather than forcing developers to guess, perhaps we should acknowledge uncertainty and plan accordingly. |
| **Testing Shows Presence of Bugs, Not Absence** | [Oct 17, 2020](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6723227948041719808) - Dijkstra quote on testing | A post highlighting the fundamental principle that testing can only show bugs exist, never prove their absence. This connects to broader themes about the ego-driven belief that code can be "bug-free" and the importance of continuous testing and deployment rather than big-bang releases. |

## Key Themes and Insights

### **The Human Side of Technical Work**

The 2021 shares consistently return to a central tension: software development is fundamentally about people, yet the industry keeps trying to reduce it to mechanical processes. Whether discussing AI/ML capabilities, agile frameworks, or technical practices, the underlying current is that what makes developers valuable isn't what they *do* (typing code) but what they *know* (domain understanding, design thinking, empathy for users). The posts push back against the commodification of software work, insisting that feelings, judgment, and human connection are irreducible elements of building good software.

### **Coaching as Bridging Work**

Multiple posts describe technical coaching not as telling people what to do, but as helping them discover how to work together differently. The role requires someone who has done the work themselves (deep software engineering experience) but can resist the urge to be the hero and instead elevate others. There's an emphasis on coaching being about changing *how* people collaborate, not just implementing specific practices. The coach's job is to help teams cross from intellectual understanding to daily practice - which is hard because changing habits is hard.

### **Frameworks Don't Transform Organizations**

A recurring insight is that agile frameworks (Scrum, SAFe, etc.) are neutral containers. They don't make you agile - they just reveal where you're not agile. Transformation happens through the hard work of responding to what the framework reveals: changing how people collaborate, breaking down silos, improving feedback loops, addressing systemic delays. The posts push back against the idea that adopting a framework is the goal, positioning it instead as merely a step on a continuous improvement journey.

### **The Limits and Possibilities of Automation**

The 2021 posts show growing engagement with machine learning and AI, but with a critical, grounded perspective. There's acknowledgment that LLMs excel at pattern recognition and can automate certain kinds of work, but also clear articulation of what they can't do: they can't feel, can't truly reason, can't build the tacit knowledge that comes from lived experience. The opportunity isn't to replace developers but to free them from drudgery so they can focus on the human, creative, empathetic work that machines can't do.

### **The Pervasive Estimation Problem**

Though not always explicit, the challenge of software estimation threads through the year. Developers are asked to estimate based on having done similar work before, but the pace of change means conditions are never the same twice. Tools change, team composition changes, understanding evolves. The tension is between business's desire for predictability and software's inherent uncertainty. Rather than seeing this as a developer failing, it's reframed as a natural consequence of adaptive, innovative work.

### **Quality Built In, Not Inspected In**

Several posts touch on testing, DevOps, and technical practices with a consistent message: you can't inspect quality into a product after the fact. The value of automated testing isn't just catching bugs - it's enabling fast feedback, reducing fear of change, and building confidence. DevOps pipelines matter because they enable rapid, safe deployment. TDD matters not because of the tests themselves but because it merges design and implementation into a tight feedback loop. Quality emerges from how you work, not from a separate QA phase.
