# LinkedIn Post Ideas from 2020

## Proposed Blog Post Ideas

| Proposed blog post (working title) | Source material & URLs | Notes |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Testing as Design: Why Bug-Free is a Myth** | [Oct 17, 2020](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6723227948041719808) - "Testing shows the presence of bugs, not the absence" reminder about Dijkstra quote | Single focused post on the reality that testing reveals bugs but can never prove their absence. Discusses the ego trap of thinking code is bug-free and the importance of balancing implementation with testing effort. Core tension: confidence vs. proof. |
| **Remote Panels and the Evolution of Agile Discourse** | [Jul 24, 2020](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6692464266945069056) - TDD panel discussion announcement | Single share about participating in a TDD panel. Could expand into broader thoughts about how remote events during 2020 changed how we share knowledge and build community in the agile/technical practices space. The shift from in-person to virtual discourse. |

## Key Themes and Insights

### The Scarcity of Reflection

Only two LinkedIn shares from 2020 were captured in this dataset. This dramatic reduction from previous years (2019, 2021, etc. have substantially more activity) suggests several possibilities worth exploring:

**The COVID-19 Impact on Professional Discourse**
2020 was the year everything changed. The pandemic forced a rapid shift to remote work, disrupted communities, and likely consumed much of the energy that would have gone into public reflection and sharing. The sparse posting may reflect a year spent adapting rather than articulating—surviving rather than synthesizing.

**Quality Over Quantity in Crisis**
The two shares that did make it through both carry weight. One invokes Dijkstra's timeless wisdom about testing's limitations—a grounding reminder when chaos surrounds us. The other signals continued commitment to community through panel participation. Perhaps crisis stripped away performative posting and left only what truly mattered.

**Testing as Foundational Truth**
The Dijkstra quote about testing revealing bugs but never proving their absence appears as a north star principle. This isn't about test-driven development dogma—it's about intellectual humility in the face of complexity. The reminder that ego can drive us to false confidence, that "modern" deployment practices don't excuse us from rigor, speaks to a deeper theme about craftsmanship surviving disruption.

**Community Continuity Through Virtual Spaces**
The TDD panel represents adaptation—moving technical discourse online, maintaining connections when physical gatherings became impossible. This single share hints at a broader story about how technical communities transformed in 2020, how they found new ways to learn together when old patterns broke.

### What's Missing

The silence speaks volumes. Where are the shares about:
- Remote work transitions and their impact on pair programming, mob programming, ensemble practices?
- Testing strategies when teams can't gather around a screen?
- How technical practices held teams together (or failed to) during lockdowns?
- The intersection of technical excellence and human resilience during crisis?

These absences might themselves be the story—that 2020 was too immediate, too raw, too consuming to synthesize into posts. Or perhaps the synthesis happened elsewhere: in Zoom rooms with teams, in one-on-one coaching conversations, in the lived experience of helping organizations survive.

### The Enduring Questions

Even in just two shares, the core tensions remain:
- **Proof vs. Evidence**: We can show bugs exist, never that they don't
- **Confidence vs. Humility**: Ego traps us into believing our code is perfect
- **Connection vs. Distance**: Community persisted even when we couldn't be together
- **Practice vs. Crisis**: Technical excellence matters especially when everything else is uncertain

### A Possible Blog Direction

Rather than multiple posts from this sparse year, consider one reflective piece: **"What We Didn't Say: Software Craftsmanship in the Year Everything Changed"**

This could explore:
- Why some years demand action over articulation
- How technical practices serve as anchors during disruption
- The gap between what we lived and what we wrote
- Testing not just code, but our assumptions about how we work
- The invisible infrastructure of community that held when tested by distance

The meta-insight may be that 2020's greatest lesson wasn't captured in posts—it was written in survival, adaptation, and the quiet continuation of craft when the world fell apart.
