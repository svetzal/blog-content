| **The Journey from Apprentice to Craftsman: A Developer's Path** | "Signs of Software Craftsmanship" series (multiple posts Sept 2014)<br>- [Apprentice mindset](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5917333584322011136)<br>- [Journeyman achieved](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5915987037223153664)<br>- [Craftsman status](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5915262170941120512)<br>- [Dreyfus Model](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5916711723074617344) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition))<br>- [Shuhari](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5913450315641823232) | Throughout September 2014, a series of "Signs of Software Craftsmanship" posts explored the stages of developer growth. These posts connect the traditional martial arts concept of Shuhari with the Dreyfus Model of Skills Acquisition to frame software development as a craft journey. The recurring theme is that being good at writing code is merely the minimum—true craftsmanship involves understanding when to apply (and break) rules, continuous learning, and recognizing that "it depends" becomes your most honest answer. This could become a reflective essay on professional growth that transcends simple technical skill. |
| **Code as Communication: Why How Matters as Much as What** | - [How it's done is as important as having it done](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5918450956185399296)<br>- [Being good at code is the minimum](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5917711067093430272)<br>- [Writing code is developer's least helpful activity](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6332986652826300416)<br>- [Invest in product, not pile of code](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5846603983333892097) | Multiple posts emphasize that craftsmanship isn't about the artifact (code) but the approach, communication, and long-term thinking. The tension here is between "getting it done" and "doing it right"—with the insight that these aren't actually opposed. Code communicates intent to future maintainers; it's a product asset, not just a technical artifact. This theme connects software craftsmanship to product thinking and challenges the "just ship it" mentality. |
| **The Fear Factor: When Technical Debt Paralyzes Teams** | - [If you're afraid to change your code, you're doing it wrong](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5916968415477657600)<br>- [When changing code is as easy as writing it](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5913087928770269184)<br>- [Business asks for changes and it's ok](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5849125511644581895)<br>- [Waking up realizing yesterday's code sucks](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5914899778721837056) | Fear of changing code is a symptom, not the disease. These posts explore how technical debt and poor practices create organizational paralysis—teams become unable to respond to business needs because the codebase has become brittle. The aspiration is code that's as easy to change as it was to write initially, enabling business agility. The cold-sweat realization about yesterday's code suggests that continuous improvement and refactoring should be normalized rather than seen as waste. |
| **Testing as Design, Not Afterthought** | - [Writing tests so you can code quickly](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5918073504095305728)<br>- [Tests because you were told to = Apprentice](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5917333584322011136) | The distinction between writing tests because you're told to versus writing them to enable fast, confident development. This tension reveals testing as a design practice, not quality assurance theater. When you understand tests as a design tool that accelerates development rather than slows it down, you've crossed a threshold in your craft. |
| **Copy-Paste Culture: The Hidden Complexity Multiplier** | - [Remove copy-paste from IDEs](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5923448376283668481) | A provocative challenge to one of the most basic programming shortcuts. While seemingly hyperbolic, this points to how easily developers create duplication that becomes maintenance nightmares. It's about understanding DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) at a deeper level—not just about keystrokes saved, but about knowledge duplication and the compounding cost of having the same logic in multiple places. |
| **The Illusion of the Blank Slate: Ideas, Fragility, and Psychological Safety** | - [Are good ideas so fragile?](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5925985082165731328)<br>- [Know your nurturing and hostile collaborators](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5925985082165731328) | This explores psychological safety in software teams. Good ideas aren't actually fragile, but the environment can crush them. Knowing who will nurture versus who will attack ideas in their infancy is crucial for innovation. This connects to the broader agile values of people and interactions, and challenges the myth that "good ideas speak for themselves." |
| **Community Practice: Durham Code Retreat and the Value of Deliberate Practice** | - Durham Code Retreat announcements (March 2014, Sept 2014)<br>- [Code Retreat underway](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5919090175228547072)<br>- [Epic robocode battle](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5919146740073660416)<br>- [Winner announcement](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5919147547749814272)<br>- Community Code Kata sessions | Multiple posts throughout 2014 promoted local community events—Durham Code Retreats, Community Code Katas, and Robocode competitions. The emphasis on practice outside of production pressure, welcoming developers of any language/level, and the joy of collective learning. This could explore why deliberate practice matters in software development and how community spaces create better developers. |
| **"Why?" as a Superpower: Questioning Features Before Building** | - [Response to estimates: "Why do this?"](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5913812656883535872) | Rather than immediately estimating how long a feature will take, asking "Why do this?" This reframes the developer's role from order-taker to problem-solver and business partner. It challenges the factory model of software development where developers are just "resources" who implement what they're told. |
| **Tool Choices and Developer Experience Matter** | - [HomeBrew link](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5929960881000579084)<br>- [JavaScript levelling up](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5832099155056533504)<br>- [Functional programming learning](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5914899778721837056) | Brief mentions of tooling and learning new approaches. JavaScript described as "wacky misunderstood language," choosing to learn functional programming for new problem-solving approaches. These snippets reveal a craftsperson's relationship to their tools and continuous expansion of their mental models. |
| **The Business of Software Craftsmanship: Finding Work and Building Community** | - [Business is shifting, looking for contracts](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5850283464808472583)<br>- [Deciding on CRM system](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5864825289778937856)<br>- [Filling out LinkedIn connections](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5847348620428324869)<br>- [Referral with Star Wars joke](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5831451693694320642) | Behind-the-scenes glimpses of running a consulting practice—the business realities, relationship management, and personal touches (like the Star Wars/Star Trek referral joke). This humanizes the consultant/coach role and acknowledges the business side of craft work. |

## Key Themes and Insights

### **Software Development as Craft, Not Just Skill**

The dominant theme of 2014 was establishing software development as a craft journey with recognizable stages of mastery. The "Signs of Software Craftsmanship" series wasn't just promotional content for Code Retreat events—it articulated a philosophy. Drawing on the Dreyfus Model of Skills Acquisition and the martial arts concept of Shuhari, these posts positioned coding as a discipline requiring apprenticeship, journeyman experience, and eventual mastery. The key insight: being good at writing code is the *minimum* requirement. True craftsmanship involves knowing when to apply rules, when to break them, and ultimately recognizing that "it depends" becomes your most honest answer.

### **Fear as the Enemy of Agility**

Multiple posts circled around a core tension: teams that fear changing their code cannot be agile. When developers wake up "in a cold sweat, realizing the code you wrote yesterday sucks," that's actually healthy self-reflection. The problem is when organizational structures, technical debt, or lack of tests make acting on that realization impossible. The aspiration expressed was code that's as easy to change as it was to write initially—only then can the business truly respond to market demands. Fear is the symptom; brittle code is the disease.

### **Testing as Design Practice, Not Quality Theater**

The distinction between writing tests because you were told to (Apprentice mindset) versus writing tests because they enable you to code quickly and confidently (Craftsman mindset) appears repeatedly. This reframes testing from a quality assurance activity to a design practice—tests aren't something you add after the fact to prove correctness; they're how you discover good designs and maintain the courage to change code. This connects to broader themes of TDD and the role of quality professionals in agile teams.

### **Communication Trumps Code**

"Writing code is a software developer's least helpful activity." This provocative stance appears alongside exhortations to "invest in your product, not the pile of code that happens to embody it today." The through-line: code is communication—to future maintainers, to the business domain, to other systems. How code is written matters as much as whether it works. This challenges the "just ship it" mentality and positions developers as communicators and designers, not just implementers.

### **Community and Deliberate Practice**

Throughout 2014, consistent promotion of Durham Code Retreats, Community Code Katas, and Robocode competitions reveals a belief in community-based learning and deliberate practice. These events welcomed developers of "any language, any level"—creating safe spaces to practice craft outside production pressure. The joy in announcing winners and celebrating participation suggests that building a community of practice is as important as individual skill development.

### **The Question "Why?" as Professional Responsibility**

When asked for feature estimates, responding with "Why do this?" reframes the developer's role from order-taker to business partner. This isn't insubordination—it's professional responsibility. Understanding the business problem before committing to a technical solution is core to delivering value rather than just delivering code. This theme challenges the factory model of software development.

### **Learning as Continuous Expansion**

Brief mentions of learning functional programming "to learn a new approach to problems," leveling up JavaScript capabilities, and exploring tools reveal a craftsperson's relationship to learning. Mastery isn't arriving at a destination; it's continually expanding your repertoire of approaches. When "it depends" becomes your answer, you need a broader toolkit to choose from.

### **Psychological Safety and the Fragility of Innovation**

"Are good ideas so fragile that exposing them in their infancy might stamp them out?" This question touches on psychological safety—the recognition that good ideas aren't actually fragile, but hostile collaborators can crush them. Knowing who will nurture versus who will attack ideas in their vulnerable early stages is crucial for innovation. This connects technical practices to team dynamics and organizational culture.

### **The Human Side of Consulting**

Glimpses of the business side—shifting work, CRM decisions, filling out LinkedIn connections, making referral jokes about Star Wars versus Star Trek—humanize the consultant role. Building a practice isn't just about technical excellence; it's about relationships, business operations, and maintaining your humanity (and humor) through it all.
