| **DevOps as Fast Feedback, Not Just Automation** | [Aug 8, 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6432927066395602944) - DevOps pipeline's biggest value is fast feedback, not just quality inspection | This post captures a key insight about DevOps that many teams miss: it's not about automating quality checks, but about creating rapid feedback loops. The tension between "chasing DevOps" and understanding its real purpose could explore how teams get distracted by tooling rather than focusing on learning velocity. |
| **Visibility: Windows to the Road, Not the Engine** | [Feb 1, 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6364851700578291712) - Metaphor about car windows showing the road ahead, not the engine | This metaphor about organizational visibility is rich with possibility. What information do software organizations surface? Are we showing people what matters (the road ahead - outcomes, customer impact, market signals) or drowning them in implementation details (the engine - burndown charts, velocity, story points)? Connects to the broader question of what metrics actually help teams navigate. |
| **Automation, Creativity, and What Comes After** | [Jan 12, 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6357564180953866240) - During agile transformation, we automate past work but forget that creativity and humanity are needed after automation; External link: [Designer's Guide to the Future](https://blog.prototypr.io/a-designers-guide-to-the-future-5b68566e36bf) | This post touches on a perennial tension: in our rush to automate "All The Things," we can lose sight of what makes us human. It hints at the paradox of agile transformation - we implement practices to move faster, but what are we moving toward? The external link suggests this connects to broader questions about the future of creative work. Could explore what developers, designers, and knowledge workers do when the mechanical parts of their jobs disappear. |
| **Keeping Your Skills Sharp Between Gigs** | [Nov 16, 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6469041633714331648) - Management consulting by day, Twitch streaming coding by night; [Sep 3, 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6442518207424196608) - Exploring livestream coding on Twitch to stay sharp; External link: [Twitch collection](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/5ftbYtNbXRX9DQ) | Two posts about staying connected to hands-on coding while traveling for consulting work, using Twitch streaming as a practice ground. This speaks to the challenge many senior developers and consultants face: how do you maintain your technical edge when you're not coding daily? The use of live streaming as a practice mechanism is interesting - public accountability, building in public, finding community. Could explore deliberate practice strategies for experienced developers. |
| **Testing Isn't Separate from Development** | [Sep 28, 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6451436206860361729) - Building SDET training programs should introduce testing techniques with each technology layer, not separately | Short but pointed: testing education often treats testing as a separate discipline, but it should be integrated with technology teaching from the start. This connects to broader themes about how we silo roles and knowledge in software organizations. Could explore how artificial separation between "dev" and "test" hurts both quality and learning. |
| **Who Really Produces the Bugs?** | [Jun 17, 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6414123447449841664) - If you think only developers produce bugs, spend time with them | This provocative one-liner invites reflection on how bugs emerge from organizational systems, not just code. Bugs come from unclear requirements, competing priorities, technical debt, organizational friction, communication breakdowns - not just developers making mistakes. Could unpack the systems thinking behind this statement. |
| **Authentic Inclusion: Beyond Performative Diversity** | [Aug 11, 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6433878298421456896) - Microsoft LGBTQ+ inclusion event critique: drag performances can alienate trans/gender non-conforming people who see their identities caricatured | This post critiques how companies approach inclusion superficially, leading with stereotypes (alcohol, drag) rather than creating genuinely welcoming spaces. It's a call for more thoughtful, informed approaches to diversity work. Could explore the difference between performative diversity and authentic inclusion, drawing on personal experience as a trans woman in tech. |
| **Mentorship Through the Ages** | [Mar 31, 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6385804753288327168) - Awareness of distant mentors and relying on their historical wisdom rather than awaiting new work | Reflection on the loss of a mentor and how we carry forward the wisdom of people who've shaped us, even when they're no longer producing new work. This touches on how we learn from the field's elders and how their ideas continue to influence us. Could explore the nature of mentorship, lineage in software thinking, and how we honor the giants on whose shoulders we stand. |
| **Quiet Acts of Allyship** | [Mar 9, 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A6377708682263699456) - International Women's Day: always amplifying women's voices without making a big deal about it | Brief reflection on consistently amplifying women's voices in tech as an everyday practice, not just on special occasions. This speaks to how allyship works best as consistent, unglamorous work rather than performative gestures. Could explore what effective allyship looks like in practice, especially in technical communities. |

## Key Themes and Insights

### **The Real Purpose of DevOps and Automation**

Two posts from 2018 wrestle with what automation is actually for. One insists that DevOps is fundamentally about fast feedback, not quality gates - it's a learning accelerator, not a gatekeeper. The other warns that in agile transformations, we can become so focused on automating yesterday's work that we forget to ask what our creativity and humanity are for after the automation is done. Together, they suggest that tools and practices are only valuable when we're clear about their purpose. Automation should free us for higher-order thinking, not just make us faster at the wrong things.

### **Integration Over Separation**

Multiple posts challenge artificial boundaries. Testing shouldn't be taught separately from technology - it's integral to learning how to build. Developers aren't the only ones who produce bugs - bugs emerge from organizational systems. When we silo knowledge, roles, and responsibility, we miss how everything connects. The call is toward holistic thinking and integrated practice.

### **Visibility and What We Choose to Surface**

The car window metaphor cuts deep: organizations spend enormous energy making the engine visible (velocity, story points, burndown charts) while obscuring the view of the road ahead (outcomes, customer impact, market signals). What we choose to make visible shapes what people pay attention to and what decisions they make. The question isn't just "are we measuring?" but "are we looking at what actually helps us navigate?"

### **Maintaining Technical Practice in Consulting Life**

The Twitch streaming posts reveal a personal strategy for staying sharp: build in public, practice deliberately, create accountability through community. For consultants and senior developers who no longer code daily, this represents a broader challenge - how do you maintain the skills that made you valuable in the first place? The answer seems to involve finding new contexts for practice and staying connected to the craft.

### **Authentic Inclusion Requires Depth**

The critique of Microsoft's LGBTQ+ event and the quiet note about amplifying women's voices both point toward what real inclusion looks like. It's not performative - not drag shows and corporate rainbows, not single-day celebrations. It's thoughtful, informed, daily practice. It requires understanding the communities you claim to support well enough to avoid caricature. It means showing up consistently without seeking credit.

### **Learning from Our Lineages**

The reflection on distant mentors acknowledges something rarely discussed: much of what shapes us as professionals comes from people we've never met, through their books, papers, and accumulated wisdom. We stand in lineages of thought, carrying forward ideas that matter. When a mentor stops producing new work - through retirement, death, or other reasons - we don't stop learning from them. Their influence becomes part of how we think.

### **Community and Belonging**

Brief references to Agile Coach Camp, facilitation friends in Toronto, and the broader coaching community suggest that this year was one of connection. The work matters more when it's done with people who understand it. Finding your tribe - the people who get what you're trying to do - isn't a luxury. It's how you sustain the work over time.

These posts from 2018 reveal someone trying to hold onto craft and humanity while navigating the business of consulting. They resist simplification, push back against surface-level solutions, and keep asking what we're really trying to accomplish. The through-line is integration - of testing and development, of automation and creativity, of inclusion and authenticity, of past wisdom and present practice.
