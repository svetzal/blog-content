Leadership as tools not labels<br>[2019-03-12](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A7040658272919441408) - "Transformation starts and ends with leadership" | Explores the complex role of the agile coach. How much responsibility do they have for organizational change? What happens when leadership becomes the blocker? Coaches help reveal problems, but can't force change - and labeling leaders limits their growth potential. |

## Key Themes and Insights

### **The Illusion of Process Solutions**

Throughout 2019, a recurring frustration emerges: organizations treat agile frameworks as silver bullets when they're actually diagnostic tools. Scrum, SAFe, and other frameworks don't fix problems—they reveal them. The hard work of transformation begins only after you see what's broken. This theme connects to the broader misconception that "agile teams build software faster," which has done tremendous damage by focusing on local optimization (velocity, speed) rather than system-level effectiveness.

### **The Measurement Trap**

Multiple posts challenge the way organizations measure software work. Velocity as a metric encourages the wrong behaviors. Estimates force developers into predictability at the cost of adaptation—yet their very inability to estimate reliably is a feature, not a bug, of innovative work. The real question becomes: what should we measure instead? Perhaps not the people in the system, but the system itself—the spaces between people where 90%+ of delay actually happens.

### **The Human Foundation of Technical Work**

A powerful theme emerges around the deeply human nature of software development. Code is communication. Culture can only be influenced through individuals, not mandated from above. Collaboration trumps artifacts every time—no user story or architectural diagram can replace actual human interaction. When developers receive feedback about bringing warmth and humanity to technical practice, it reveals what's often missing: recognition that software development is fundamentally about people working together.

### **Beyond Binary Thinking**

Several posts push back against the reductionist tendencies in software organizations. "What is 'the work'?" challenges the assumption that tasks equal value. Organizations focus on completing work items rather than achieving outcomes. Similarly, the pressure to label everything (frameworks, languages, job roles) creates echo chambers that prevent cross-pollination of ideas. The courage to cross boundaries and think in shades of gray, not black and white, is what enables real innovation.

### **The Leadership Challenge**

Transformation starts and ends with leadership—yet organizations often miss this. When "that leader is killing our agile transformation," the response can't be to label them as transactional or command-and-control. Instead, help leaders expand their toolbox of approaches. Change happens through influence and example, not force. Coaches don't own organizational change; they help create conditions where it can happen.

### **Testing as Design, Not Validation**

The 2019 posts on testing reveal a deeper understanding: tests aren't just about catching bugs or hitting coverage numbers. They're about confidence to change, about design feedback, about seeing failures that tell you the test actually works. A journey transforming quality culture with SDETs isn't just about more test automation—it's about changing how teams think about quality from the start.

### **The Estimate Paradox**

A particularly charged theme emerges around estimation: developers can only estimate what they've done before, in the same conditions, with the same tools, with the same team—conditions that never repeat in a field of constant change. The industry's obsession with estimates reveals a misunderstanding of knowledge work. Instead of forcing developers to predict the unpredictable, perhaps we should question why we need those predictions in the first place, or acknowledge that business predictions about markets are equally uncertain.

### **The Personal Journey**

A quieter but significant thread: the personal dimension of transformation work. Trans Day of Visibility posts acknowledge that identity and privilege intersect with career. Gratitude from teams for human-centered coaching. The recognition that helping people grow is more fulfilling than writing code alone. These moments remind us that agile transformation isn't an organizational change program—it's thousands of individual human transformations.
