| **The Dreyfus Model and Software Craftsmanship: Growing from Apprentice to Master** | Multiple "Signs of Software Craftsmanship" posts throughout November-December 2013 ([Nov 27](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5811518975955603461), [Dec 2](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5813262947786854403), [Dec 3](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5813629150724263937), [Dec 4](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5813991378514247685))<br/>SCNA 2013 reflections on Dreyfus model ([Nov 8](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5804722873520521223)): "Lots of talk today around Dreyfus' paper" with reference to http://ow.ly/qDW1A | A serialized "Signs of Software Craftsmanship" campaign ran throughout late 2013, mapping development stages to skill levels. These connected explicitly to the Dreyfus Model of Skills Acquisition, which provides a framework for understanding how developers progress from novice through apprentice, journeyman, to craftsman levels. The posts create a narrative arc about professional growth, distinguishing between compliance-driven work ("you write tests because you were told to") versus mastery ("you write tests so that you can code quickly"). This could explore the journey from following rules to understanding context and achieving nuanced judgment. |
| **Tacit Knowledge: What We Can't Write Down But Must Pass Along** | SCNA 2013 Dave Thomas talk on tacit knowledge ([Nov 8](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5804719142276071433)): "Last talk today was Dave Thomas, excellent illustration of tacit knowledge"<br/>Related reflection ([Nov 8](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5804721634892210183)): "Tacit Knowledge– Don't teach what you were taught, infuse people with what you've learned and inspire them with your passion"<br/>The chicken sexing example ([Nov 8](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5804722204910706690)): "Crazy thought from today, chicken sexing skill as an example of tacit knowledge" | These posts capture a profound insight from SCNA 2013 about knowledge that can't be codified in documentation or training manuals. The chicken sexing example is particularly memorable—a skill that can only be learned through guided practice with immediate feedback, not from reading about it. This tension between explicit and tacit knowledge is central to software craftsmanship and apprenticeship models. The post could explore how experienced developers hold crucial tacit knowledge about code quality, design decisions, and team dynamics that can only be transmitted through pairing, mentoring, and shared experience. |
| **How It Is Done Is As Important As Being Done: The Case for Craftsmanship** | Sandro Mancuso SCNA 2013 talk ([Nov 9](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5804983214204694534)): "Absolutely inspiring talk on craftsmanship by @sandromancuso ... How it is done is as important as being done"<br/>Quality vs. speed tension ([Nov 9](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5804983736055779334)): "How do we produce quality work as fast as others produce crap? I suppose that depends on your definition of crap"<br/>Refactoring post-TDD ([Dec 12](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5816892159089348617)): "you hate not having the time to refactor after your tests pass, and you take it anyways"<br/>Code quality evolution ([Dec 6](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5814716190484234247)): "the code you wrote yesterday sucks, and you're trying to make tomorrow's code better" | These shares capture the fundamental tension in software development: the pressure to ship quickly versus the discipline to build sustainably. Mancuso's framing—that *how* we build is as important as *what* we build—directly challenges the "just get it done" mentality. The posts reveal a practitioner's perspective on technical excellence as more than perfectionism: it's about sustainability, maintainability, and professional responsibility. The ongoing refinement ("code you wrote yesterday sucks") reflects growth mindset and continuous improvement, while the refactoring commitment shows discipline against deadline pressure. This could be a manifesto-style post defending craftsmanship against "move fast and break things" culture. |
| **Hypothesis-Driven Development: Building a Business on Learning, Not Guessing** | Amy Hoy article share ([Sep 23](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5788011350785548288)): "Absolutely love this, Amy nails it - building a business using Hypothesis-Driven Development" - http://ow.ly/p8HBe<br/>Related to Gojko's "Make Impacts, Not Software" talk at Agile Tour Toronto ([Oct 29](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5800938503072145413))<br/>Product owner priorities ([Jul 6](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5759224448376922115)): "Your most important job as product owner? Say 'no'" - http://ow.ly/1YzlZy | These posts challenge the assumption that software development is primarily about building features. Instead, they advocate for a scientific approach: forming hypotheses about what will create value, testing those hypotheses, and learning from the results. This connects product thinking with agile practices and lean startup principles. The product owner's role as strategic gatekeeper ("say no") and Gojko's emphasis on outcomes over output both reinforce this theme. This could explore how teams can shift from a feature factory mindset to a learning organization that builds the right thing, not just builds things right. |
| **Why Estimates Are Unreliable and What to Do Instead** | Estimates reliability question ([Jul 8](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5759820014668509188)): "If estimates are unreliable, how do we make good decisions?" - http://ow.ly/1YKFMw<br/>Dan North connection ([Jul 8](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5759802158446817281)): "Dan is right on the mark here again. I can't help thinking this ties in to #noestimates somewhere"<br/>Alternative to estimation ([Nov 28](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5811815860943622151)): "if your response to feature estimate requests is 'Why do this?', you may be doing it right"<br/>Agile Tour Toronto #NoEstimates puzzle challenge ([Oct 29](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5801037828221579264), [Oct 29](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5801053958302625794)) | This cluster of posts engages with the emerging #NoEstimates movement, questioning the traditional practice of software estimation. Rather than accepting estimates as necessary evil, these posts suggest reframing the conversation: instead of "how long will this take?" ask "why should we do this at all?" This connects to hypothesis-driven development and outcome-focused thinking. The puzzle challenge at Agile Tour Toronto provided hands-on experience with alternative approaches to planning and coordination without traditional estimation. This post could explore the underlying reasons estimates fail (complexity, novelty, learning) and offer practical alternatives like timeboxing, incrementalism, and value-based prioritization. |
| **BDD Done Right: The Necessity of Conversation** | Liz Keogh on BDD ([Feb 8](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1374279171)): "If you can't have those conversations, stop. You can't do BDD" - http://ow.ly/hyuz2<br/>Lean/BDD connection ([Feb 9](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1374591892)): "Ignorance is the constraint. Missing an opportunity to learn is waste" via @lunivore - http://ow.ly/hzhs0<br/>InfoQ interview recommendation ([Dec 5, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1337619463)): Interview between Todd Charron and Liz Keogh on BDD and testing - http://ow.ly/fPsgc | These posts capture Liz Keogh's fundamental insight about BDD: it's not about tools or test frameworks, it's about collaborative conversations that expose ignorance and drive learning. The blunt directive "If you can't have those conversations, stop" challenges teams implementing BDD mechanically without the human collaboration that gives it power. The lean framing ("ignorance is the constraint") reframes testing and specification as learning activities, not compliance activities. This could be a corrective post for teams treating BDD as "Cucumber scenarios" rather than as a discovery and communication discipline. |
| **Schema Design and Social Justice: The Biases We Code Into Our Systems** | Coraline Ada Ehmke talk at SCNA 2013 ([Nov 8](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5804676343480610817)): "Watch the biases you place on your data, and the people you alienate from your product in the schema you choose" | This single powerful share references a talk about how database schemas and data models encode social biases and can alienate users. Examples might include gender fields limited to binary choices, name fields that don't accommodate non-Western naming conventions, or address formats that assume US/European structures. This is an early recognition (for 2013) of how technical decisions carry social and ethical weight. The post could explore concrete examples of exclusionary design, the impact on marginalized users, and how thoughtful schema design becomes an act of inclusion and justice. |
| **The Code Retreat: Deliberate Practice for Software Developers** | Multiple Code Retreat promotional posts ([Dec 13](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5817254556224364549), [Dec 11](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5816618800736411650), [Dec 9](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5815804724376928261), [Dec 2](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5813283742810542082))<br/>Kata practice motivation ([Dec 11](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5816529702604943362)): "you can't wait for your next kata, 'cause you're dying to try out a new idea on that same old problem"<br/>Testing mindset ([Dec 10](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5816167347400384516)): "if you write tests so that you can code quickly, rather than because you were told to, you might be a Craftsman" | Heavy promotion for the Global Day of Code Retreat in Durham Region reflects commitment to deliberate practice in software development. Code retreats create a safe space to experiment with ideas, practice techniques like TDD, and explore design patterns without production pressure. The kata enthusiasm ("dying to try out a new idea on that same old problem") captures the craftsman mindset: constraints enable creativity, and repetition builds mastery. This post could explain what makes code retreats valuable, how they differ from typical work, and why experienced developers keep returning to the same exercises. |
| **Mobile Development Realities: Native vs. Web, Security Updates, and Cross-Platform Strategies** | iOS 7 readiness ([Sep 10](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5783262701950074883)): "iOS 7 ships September 18th - are your apps ready?"<br/>Native vs. wrapped web app criticism ([Jun 24](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5754949029305786376)): "I love when 'native mobile app' means a web app wrapped in Cordova. *facepalm*"<br/>Android update challenges ([Feb 5](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1371641164)): "How often do you update the OS on your Android? Does your carrier even provide updates?" - http://ow.ly/hqIiF<br/>Cross-platform development ([Feb 16](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1379378337)): "Looking for companies interested in saving 40% on cross-platform mobile systems development"<br/>Apple iPad in healthcare ([Jun 4](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1451850955)): Success story about iPad deployment at Ottawa Hospital - http://ow.ly/lHzkW<br/>BlackBerry NDK limitations ([Jul 24](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5765774708121292803)): "Blackberry NDK compiler still only based on GCC 4.6. I really need them to move to 4.8. C++11 or bust!"<br/>Apple Configurator for device management ([Oct 10, 2012](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A1308297457)): "If you're not using it to manage your business' iOS devices, you're missing out!" | These posts capture the messy reality of mobile development in 2013: fragmented Android update ecosystem, the temptation and limitations of cross-platform web wrappers, the security and deployment challenges of enterprise mobile, and the practical tradeoffs of native versus hybrid approaches. The frustration with wrapped web apps and the challenges of platform differences show someone deeply engaged with mobile development realities rather than hype. This could be a practitioner's honest account of what actually matters when building mobile applications: not which platform "wins," but how to serve users well within real-world constraints. |
| **Learning in Public: Women in Technology and Inclusive Tech Communities** | ReThinkGirls event ([Nov 3](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5802771485496352774)): "We need more women in technology, our future depends on it!" with booth photos ([Nov 3](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5802775320231059460))<br/>Chameleon scarf project for ReThinkGirls ([Nov 1](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5802063487718924288))<br/>Daughters and technology ([Aug 8](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Ashare%3A5771372059556847623)): "My daughter Katie has just accepted her first github pull request. #github #ftw #proudmama" | These posts reveal personal investment in bringing more women and girls into technology through hands-on making, mentorship, and celebration. The progression from community outreach (ReThinkGirls) to personal mentorship (daughter's first pull request) shows both structural and individual approaches to changing tech culture. The chameleon scarf project suggests using wearable technology as an accessible entry point. This post could explore why representation matters, what works (and doesn't) in outreach to underrepresented groups, and the long game of cultural change in technology. |

## Key Themes and Insights

### **The Craftsmanship Movement as Professional Identity**

Throughout 2013, a strong narrative emerges around software craftsmanship as more than technique—it's an identity and a value system. The recurring "Signs of Software Craftsmanship" posts map a progression from apprentice (following rules because you're told) through journeyman (teaching others, recognizing context) to craftsman (writing "it depends" responses, continuously learning). This framework, explicitly grounded in the Dreyfus Model of Skills Acquisition, offers developers a roadmap for professional growth that transcends specific languages or frameworks.

The SCNA 2013 conference appears as a pivotal moment, especially Sandro Mancuso's talk asserting that *how* we build is as important as *what* we build—a direct challenge to "just ship it" culture. The tension between quality and speed, between sustainable practice and deadline pressure, runs throughout the year's posts. The craftsmanship lens reframes this not as perfectionism versus pragmatism, but as professional responsibility versus technical debt.

### **Tacit Knowledge and the Limits of Documentation**

A recurring insight is that the most important knowledge in software development cannot be written down. Dave Thomas's talk on tacit knowledge at SCNA, illustrated through the memorable example of chicken sexing, captures something profound: certain skills can only be transmitted through guided practice, pairing, and apprenticeship. This explains why documentation alone never suffices, why new team members need more than wikis, and why code review cannot replace pair programming.

This connects directly to the craftsmanship emphasis on deliberate practice (katas, code retreats) and mentorship. If expertise includes crucial elements that cannot be codified, then learning environments must create space for tacit knowledge transmission through repeated practice, immediate feedback, and close collaboration with more experienced practitioners.

### **From Outputs to Outcomes: The Product Thinking Shift**

A significant theme is the shift from feature-building to impact-making. Gojko Adzic's "Make Impacts, Not Software" talk and Amy Hoy's hypothesis-driven development both challenge the assumption that software development is fundamentally about producing code. Instead, it's about learning what creates value—and that requires treating development as experimental discovery rather than predictable execution.

This thinking directly feeds the #NoEstimates conversation emerging in 2013: if we're learning rather than executing, estimation becomes less meaningful than rapid experimentation. The product owner's primary job becomes strategic "no-saying" rather than feature accumulation. The posts suggest a fundamental reframe: from "how do we estimate this feature?" to "why should we build it at all?"

### **BDD as Collaborative Discovery, Not Test Automation**

Liz Keogh's influence is clear in the BDD-related posts: BDD is fundamentally about conversation and collaborative learning, not about Cucumber or Gherkin syntax. The blunt framing—"If you can't have those conversations, stop. You can't do BDD"—calls out teams implementing BDD mechanically without the human collaboration that makes it valuable.

The lean framing of BDD as waste reduction ("ignorance is the constraint") elevates it from quality technique to learning discipline. Tests aren't primarily about catching bugs—they're about exposing what we don't yet know and forcing conversations that align understanding across disciplines. This positions BDD as a key practice for the hypothesis-driven, outcome-focused development emerging in other posts.

### **Mobile Development Pragmatism Over Platform Wars**

The mobile development posts reveal someone deeply engaged with practical realities rather than platform advocacy. Concerns span platform fragmentation (Android updates), architectural questions (native vs. hybrid), enterprise challenges (device management, security), and tooling limitations (BlackBerry NDK). The criticism of "native" apps that are actually web wrappers reflects frustration with marketing over technical honesty.

This pragmatic stance—focused on serving users well within real constraints—contrasts with the platform wars dominating mobile discourse in 2013. The cross-platform development work and various mobile framework references suggest someone building real products, not arguing about ecosystems. The posts recognize that technical decisions have business implications (40% cost savings) and user experience consequences.

### **Technical Excellence as Social Justice**

An early (for 2013) recognition that technical decisions carry ethical weight appears in the schema design post from SCNA: the biases we encode in data models can alienate users. This connects to the women-in-tech outreach posts, revealing awareness that technology isn't neutral—who builds it and how they build it directly impacts who it serves well.

The intersection of craftsmanship (how we build), inclusion (who builds and who benefits), and product thinking (what we should build) suggests a more holistic view of technical excellence. Good code isn't just maintainable and correct—it's also equitable and accessible. This theme would become more prominent in subsequent years, but its seeds are visible here.

### **Deliberate Practice and Learning Communities**

The heavy investment in code retreats, katas, conference attendance (SCNA, Agile Tour Toronto), and community building (Agile Toronto East, ReThinkGirls) reveals someone who sees professional development as communal rather than individual. The enthusiasm for returning to the same problems ("can't wait for your next kata") reflects a craftsman's mindset: mastery comes through constrained repetition, not novelty-seeking.

The creation of learning opportunities for others (hosting code retreats, teaching at ReThinkGirls, mentoring interns) shows commitment to growing the community, not just individual skills. This aligns with the Dreyfus model progression: journeymen teach, craftsmen create learning systems. The posts suggest that building great software requires building great developers, which requires building great learning environments.
