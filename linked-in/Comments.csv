Good call on the distinction on product vs journey, but yeah, as an old cranky agilist I am also frustrated by the distractions we seem to have adopted for our journeys.

I'm not sure the tools themselves represent that intent, but it's certainly been received by the market in this way, and the purveyors of the tools are happy to leverage that for their own purposes. I think it says more about the people and hope and frustration in our field than about the tools themselves."

It makes me think that in a world in which gen ai is persistent and unavoidable there’s even more opportunity here. But when I’ve gathered my thoughts I’d love to find ways to contribute / give back. One of my main work activities right now is training developers in using Copilot, but I bring into my sessions a great deal of discussion and sharing of the implications of this stuff on our whole profession. Every week I seem to fall into another depth of things to consider. This week was the old IBM presentation slide that warned against computers making management decisions because they can’t be accountable.

How much accountability transfers from a developer to code written by an agent under their direction — I won’t say control, for hopefully obvious reasons."

There is joy in coding the syntax, watching it function, I choose more carefully and frequently my approach towards having that joy. But it’s the first adapter object, the first crack at the gateway, the opportunity to precisely demonstrate to the LLM my thoughts on where we’re going. I did this same thing in my consultancy and even before.

I remember one weekend going home and coming in Monday with a Perl based ORM to put behind a content management & publishing system. It was junk really, but it brought an important new idea to the team, and they made it infinitely better following my lead, and then I was able to encourage them to lead in their own directions.

Is the “new coding skill” (that always should have been there IMO) just technical leadership?"

What we trust is the thing we’re scrutinizing here. What makes us developers?

I’ve built many systems now, mostly prototypes but not all, where I’ve been more the supervisor than the coder.

What product manager could ever possibly feel ownership for their product when “other people build it?”

What new team member could ever feel ownership for their system when “other developers built it before them?”

This ownership thing. Perhaps I have added perspective because long before Gen AI, I had to work my brain through this as I grew my consultancy from me being the primary code producer, to me being primary mentor."

For me, this is all about capturing the messiness of how humans communicate with each other. It’s great when you can gather folks and they know what Story Mapping is supposed to be, and you can keep them on that track, but the room is so often messy with divergence, side-quests, as a facilitator it’s the skill we build to try and hold it on track, but that also includes letting divergence happen when it’s necessary and trying to help everyone actually get something out of the session anyways.

If this were a fly on the wall during a healthy story mapping session, I’d want it to literally be the visual notetaker for it. I so hate Ai generated “meeting summaries” that everyone seems infatuated with right now.

In my current experimentation I’m having trouble keeping the LLM from extrapolating into the gaps the humans are leaving behind in the conversation. It’s what I’m trying to get the visualizer to make more obvious! And in writing this, I just got an idea on a new prompt direction for it lol."

Being able to listen to your code and what it's telling you remains an important skill. That method hard to change? Maybe it's long, or spaghetti, or a conditional snarl that's hard to reason.

Pausing and listening to your code is a habit you can develop. It's funny though, we've had tools that offer real-time complexity feedback and improvement hints for decades.

When we're able to start giving this real-time feedback to the Gen AI agent, that's going to be an interesting thing.

Communicating with the agent using higher order intent I think comes with being able to recognize good and bad habits, being able to see them, understand them, name them, and communicate them. This is a real opportunity for growth for developers.

Writing on affordances this week, I brought up how we (read this like exploit the constraint in Goldratt's 5 focusing steps) exploit the relationship between team and customer and stakeholders in XP and O.G. agile. Those rich human interactions have qualities inexpressible in words (the only data LLMs can use). They lead us O.G. agilists to say things like \"the story is the placeholder for the conversation\" and try and help folks recognize the opportunities we can glean from that exchange.

And that enables us to, consciously or unconsciously, build affordances into code and software design that honour that relationship, and improve experiences."

It read a bit to me like so many TDD studies, like \"OK, these are your chosen controls, why?\". The lingering question of \"sure, but did those folks know what TDD actually is? that it's not about testing?\"

Same thing here, sure agents emit a lot of code, but then what? What code did the developers \"allow it to emit\" and then what happened with that code? To what patterns were they reshaping it to make it suitable to release? Like so much of our work as technical coaches, that \"low number\" could mean ignorance or decision, and the numbers don't say which, so we've learned how to dig in.

Like those TDD studies, this also made me long for a better study."

Sure, you've got a chance to write well tuned hand-written machine code. And you should, at least once, to learn. But we choose into our programming languages seeking a better pace of solving the challenges around us.

I think this is the same, and the abstractions I wrangle directing agentic work are the broader coding abstractions that are taught (or, sadly, mostly not taught) in modern software engineering. I've been seeking new levels of performance in releasing the syntax and focusing on higher order design principles, and it is paying off.

Those of us that know and think in these principles, it's well past time to write that down and teach it. Or pay attention to the people writing it down, and learn and teach that."

I've always interpreted this as toward's Peter Naur's idea that an important part of coding is the ability to communicate a higher purpose through the structure and words we use. Akin to Ward Cunningham's \"Code should read like well written prose\" which people tend to interpret as \"code must be beautiful\" however I see it like poetry, as in elicits emotion and synthesizes meaning beyond the words themselves.

Folks often reduce code to data, data for the computer to run. But I've always believed code's higher purpose is helping people communicate with each other about these why's and hopes and mental models.

Because this is how I feel about code, people are often confused by common sections I have in my prompts, in my agent instructions, folks ask \"is that really necessary there?\"

The LLMs can sometimes induce some of that feeling, but it doesn't come from them, it comes from how we direct them, so I don't think it's lost, just that we don't know how to put it there now, because many never learned that it should be there to start with."

It involves knowledge acquisition, filtering, assembling, moving to the right people and places to inform action, in a complex web of individual acquirers, filterers, assemblers, and communicators. Planning is prediction and also the design of the system of knowledge flow.

And in the future of work, perhaps the system is augmented and grown with \"Agents.\" And just like with humans, the bigger the system, the more interconnects, and the more intense the coordination challenge."

My first-pass using MkDocs and the llmstxt plugin have rendered lacklustre results. https://vetzal.com/mojentic/llms.txt is small and tight, but there's no mechanism to annotate the links with descriptive summaries to prompt the LLM to crawl them.

We still bobbed and weaved around its hallucinations (it kept suggesting incorrect usage of FastMCP, and some adhoc co-hosts jumped in to help us steer back to reality), but in that kind of very public live-coding scenario cognitive load is high and in hindsight I liked that I didn't give it the opportunity to push us out of touch with the actual code.

I like to think of code as something not to be written once, but more to be shaped and formed continuously as we learn about the problems we're solving, and how our solutions work out, if it can be even expressed as such a binary.

It's the unpredictable nature of the changes LLMs make when used as tools to reshape and reform code that scares me.

One thing that comes to mind, is that programming languages and tech stacks change over time at different scales, \"Gen AI\" might offer us an opportunity to lower the cognitive load inherent in the churn of our industry in favour of learning fundamentals that we so rarely have the space to teach.

Every new language we learn teaches us a new way to solve problems, every new perspective we work from (eg multiple hats) teaches us new ways to see and frame problems. Do we have an opportunity to hack our cognitive load and unlock this capability earlier in peoples' careers?"

If you're invested in some kind of \"final shape\" then you're IMO going to have a natural tendency to over-engineer simply to try and find some optimal finality. Some \"solution.\" Whereas if code is in an eco-cycle of calm and turbulence, as our customers are often in an ecosystem of calm and turbulence in terms of changing needs, then maybe we can better match the changes they're responding to.

In a larger paper I'm writing, I just abandoned the word \"bumbling\" because it's a little too anthropomorphic, but that randomness in the selection of next-token in the context of everything up to current-token, is kinda like bumbling, and it compounds error in every future token if it reaches too far, and that even assumes its trained weights and biases were actually following a congruent path to your own solution-path.

It's just math tho. Even the term \"hallucinating\" anthropomorphises it, because it doesn't hallucinate, it compounds errors in its calculations.

That said, it's quite guidable, and IMO a useful tool to learn with.

My paper is taking it further, I've wished for a long time people were less attached to the current bucket of source-code that currently comprises their system. The value is misplaced, especially from a product standpoint. Yes the source-code is currently likely the only precise description of what it must do. But the machine-code used to be the only precise description of what things used to have to do, and we've managed some abstractions.

For example, we don't want to pre-ordain how instructions fall into the execution pipelines on modern CPUs, that could happen all kinds of ways. We leave it to the CPU to ensure that the impact of those instructions is deterministic. So we have a non-deterministic (at least at design time) part of the system where depending on what threads are executing and what they're doing, different areas of the CPU could be doing different things every single time it runs.

So that little sandwich, it tells us some non-determinism in execution is a bit tasty. It gives us flexibility.

For example, if product work is still iterative, what does refactoring look like if we're not doing it on Java or C# code, but rather on whatever we feed to the systems we build that builds the Java or C# or whatever it is code.

What do we practice with our coachees in the dojo? What is their learning path if they don't have to start with syntax, just like we no longer have to start with opcodes and instruction pipelines on the CPU.

However TDD, I don’t think so.

You see, TDD has two key things it does. First is to break development up to flt a human’s cognitive capacity, and second to provide constant validation as tests go from red to green that builds trust in the developer that the system will work as intended, and that it will tell them as soon as it does not.

LLMs have vastly more working memory than humans, but lack reasoning and logic. We have invented mechanisms that attempt to emulate reasoning and logic, but the cognitive profile of a human and an LLM agent are vastly different.

That’s one of the things I like to play with, what is the LLM agent parallel to TDD that leverages its limitations and abilities just like TDD leverages ours.

Making a relational database perform is not just a function of spraying indexes throughout where you think they might be needed. In fact, that can be the fastest way to slow it down. Which keys will make it performant on specific versions of specific platforms in specific usage scenarios is a complex problem that IMO is difficult if not impossible to stay on top of. Instead, a good DBA team will use performance data to adjust as needed.

Maybe you can profile a simple enough application ahead-of-time and get some head-start on the indexing you want, but honestly, in a high performance dynamic environment where code changes, you have to react as things happen."

I've been thinking lately of how to illustrate this path for folks, leverage it for different purposes as you gain experience with coding and a particular system.

One other thing I've experienced, is how quickly it puts you out of touch with a codebase when it's doing the majority of the coding. All the steps of coding something out build up a mental model that is critical for us, and we are no longer doing that when it writes too much code and leaves us behind."

I think both my objection and your perspective are standing on the same carpet :) the flex in the implementation, the rigidity in the desired behaviours and outcomes.

For such flexibility we must release programming language, library, and solution approach by concentrating on the behaviours and outcomes.

So, BDD, encode the stakeholder-facing validations, throw out every iteration of the implementation.

Pretty cool idea... The bottleneck I ran into here was having the LLM be able to comprehend the implementation at different layers of abstraction. That's where my \"playing around\" is right now."

eg noodling the dom requires the framework to emit the appropriate events within itself, if you noodle the dom outside the framework you can have some pretty inconsistent state. This ties the first A (Arrange) to the specific UI framework even if the third A (Assert) can be layered away (DOM). (And also assuming I'm not trapped in a test runner required by the UI technology, eg react or angular, that forces me to write tests in a certain way).

I also agree that an abstraction layer in between the interaction model and the UI model can lose its value proposition if you're not careful.

Here's my perspective tho, for example form validation as you showed, is also a detail that means little to the business. Sure, it needs to happen but the real reason we need it is pretty abstract from whether this particular field on this particular form has the right kind of gatekeeping.

I feel like some of this is like Chicago vs London TDD. It's like a false dichotomy because in reality we leverage the technique that makes sense in the moment."

I think GenAI may be close to dismantling DOM as the bottleneck there too, which is interesting. We've never had such a potential tool for automated visual validation before.

Accessibility is tricky. We can lint for an awful lot of it at the source level. And so much of it isn't determined by the shape of the DOM but rather colours, understandability of content, etc.

What do you use for your cause / effect DOM validation? Serialization like doing characterization testing?"

Over the decades, I've used a lot of front-end techniques. The computer user-interface idioms don't change NEARLY as fast as the underlying technologies that deliver them. JSP/ASP to jQuery to Knockout to Angular to React to Next to blah blah blah it won't ever stop, and that's just web, never mind Swing, Eclipse/SWT, XUL, WPF, Maui, Qt, WxWidgets, GTK, blah blah blah

I believe the user interface framework is a detail, that should be allowed to change, without abandoning knowing whether your application can still service your customers.

That said, I also don't believe the source code you put into production is === your product. So perhaps I just think in differently coupled ways than others."

Like stripping art or music from education to do computer programming. You're teaching beginners at a stage where all they can produce is syntax rather than synthesize form and function.

I didn't connect something you mentioned there though, and it resonates so strongly with me - individual vs collaborative endeavours. I thought about how everything I do as an individual builds on someone else' thing, whether I'm remixing or just inspired by, but that's not collaborative.

The reduction of coaching to blind advice-giving or a human encyclopedia is quite a challenge. They genuinely want help, their pain-aversion doesn’t want the help to be more painful than the problem. The problem may be the problem as expressed, or may be that someone is pressuring them to do something, and the problem they expressed was just the handy thing they saw that seemed solvable. (Attribute substitution)

Every situation is complex :) but it feels horrible to be reduced to advice-giving when you’re experienced enough to know that said advice may cause harm because you don’t know the context.

I tend to class this as transactional engagement - you can’t solve the problem, but you can engage them as a fellow human and start developing a relationship, which can lead to more transformational engagement in the future as you gain their trust and confidence, and learn about their context.

That requires a certain environment and patience, though, depending on the level of pressure you have swooping in as an “expensive contractor” to have an impact before your contract term runs out :D

This is a pretty huge topic :D"

Effective retrospectives, introspection, and reflection can help a team challenge their understanding of the problem and their effectiveness in addressing it.

This introspection is critical and central to the agile  loop - learning, and then applying that knowledge."

TDD is a just-in-time and just-enough design activity. Other approaches are usually brought forward by those who typically seem to be detractors of TDD.

But when you look at what they're saying, it often boils down to \"yes, I believe design is important too, but this other (non-TDD) way has been more effective for me.\" or \"I tried TDD and it felt awkward and I don't think it brought value to my work.\"

Arguing about which design method each of our past experiences and contexts deflects us from the real problem.

Developers are often reduced to typers of code rather than designers.

The power of TDD is in merging the design and implementation activities, so they happen so close together that the feedback loop between them is indistinguishable from the main activity.

The tests force us to explore our designs, and to emerge better designs as we layer on new constraints, test by test.

The usefulness of the tests extends far beyond validating that our implementation is correct.

Making it about the tests can trap us into this limiting viewpoint that the tests are only there to validate our implementation."

ChatGPT-4 has a context window of 8000 tokens. Typically, you’d only want to use half the context window for context to leave enough context space for the LLM to generate a response for you.

The average chapter of a book is about 3,000 words or about 3,500 tokens. Books are written where ideas grow from chapter to chapter, building on each other.

So, at best, any response you get would only be able to source about a chapter of material on top of the general knowledge trained into its base model.

So, imagine an “expert” you could query that could only select a single chapter of a single book on the topic to respond.

Or, if multiple shreds were drawn from multiple books to fit into the 4,000 token limit, you'd be extracting those superficial words from the context in which they were written to stitch them together as so-called \"expert material\" like some kind of Frankenstein's monster."

The number of brains that need to comprehend a piece of code skyrockets the care that must be taken to ensure it's comprehensible across all their perspectives and backgrounds. Some of my favourite recent analytics endeavours center on the dynamics of humans touching code, how often and where and in response to what. It started as a riff on Adam Tornhill's work and took off from there."

I certainly don’t think it’s particularly different than other areas of software development. Don’t get me started on refactoring vs re-engineering and other such popularly misinterpreted / misapplied terms. And the funny thing is, who cares? We get all twisted around the axle sometimes on terminology, thinking with precise enough definitions we might sort out understanding, and perhaps sometimes it does help. What really does help, in my experience, is learning how the terms are used within a context and then helping folks along the journey of improvement, making space for empathy, and then nudging interpretation as they learn the details of what they’re doing. Honestly, I don’t even know I can express these distinctions with words, though I do often try (and fail) to do."

Think of our more nebulous terms - what is a unit? Is it language-specific? A function? A class? Think of integration testing. Are we integrating units? Architectural tiers? Is it so-called end-to-end? Look at how testing silos collapse when organizations undergo agile transformation. Who’s responsible for integration testing now? What overlaps did we not realize we had before breaking the silos apart? I believe we can find precision, within a certain context, but it’s very hard to talk to someone who’s been doing what an organization has considered “unit testing” for some time and then tell them that’s normally exclusively a developer activity. The agile testing quadrants helps here in my experience, getting folks to classify what they do in terms of how and who it helps. I use the term “word salad” because we can enjoy and gain nutrition from a salad without necessarily knowing the species of greens contained therein. For those who don’t know, it really doesn’t matter as long as it’s nutritious, and you can even allow agile practices to experiment with and guide nutritional changes, still without really knowing why."

I think frameworks like SAFe etc are necessary catalysts for change, and everyone likes to think they've nailed the formula for the perfect catalyst, but I think the real catalyst is change itself. Then how well they grasp agile principles coupled with how well thought out the framework was to catch the flailing threads of finance and audit becomes how well they withstand transformation. Never mind they're going all in against a rising crop of business that were born this way. Billions are being spent to shore up the jello mould."

Language is a critical aspect of communication, and when developers are out of touch with the business and use language for variables, functions, modules, that don't align with the business, you are pushing silos apart when they don't need to be. Sure there are technical aspects of development for which there is no suitable business language, but it should not give developers freedom to use whatever language they want when pertaining to business level functionality. If there are no commonalities in language, how are business people and developers ever going to talk intelligently about a software product?"

I'm not sure I believe in an average developer... I've been surprised sometimes at who has taught me things throughout my journey, and I think all anyone needs is the right situation and a bit of time to become exceptional. But hey, I'm an optimist and an idealist, a dangerous combination :)

@Paul agreed, it is certainly more of an oblong shape... and probably a bit irregular for most :) Oh, I think my brain is wavering a bit here between business insights and code insights; I think at a master level, business insights are certainly more frequent than code-level / structural insights.

It's kind of what I love about the fundamental aspects of Agile, that we expect developers to have business insights, to integrate with the business. Software becomes a tool for a higher purpose, rather than a purpose unto itself. Now we can get all meta and start talking about tool building :) lol"

Some folks (me included) like to \"spike\" on something getting \"researchy\" (I like that word lol) to separate it from the main path and see if we can gain and share some insight / knowledge. Spikes, though, can be hard to justify sometimes to a business, most especially if it's a consultancy and the insights are benefiting the consultant's staff / contractors rather than the business directly. Spike along a disposable prototype to gather your thoughts, then apply those insights to the core product.

I do wish it was required for developers to study more code. Look at majors like english, arts, politics, the requirement to study and understand prior works. I think we need this in the software field. Code-review practices are a step forward, but I think we need our Shakespeare's, our William Faulkner's, with facilitated discussion, as part of our educational system. We have a field full of writers that don't take the time to read.

@Paul that was definitely more out of my own head :) that balance is truly a decision to be made, maybe continually.

I see refactoring practiced across skill levels kind of like a bell curve. Novices don't know why, and masters need to a lot less, the journeymen in the middle do a lot and I think that's how they build their eye for craftsmanship. I think a lot about the master level, it's extremely rare, there just aren't a lot of people in this field that operate at that level. I do a lot of coding, been doing so for over 35 years, and I'm not sure I'll ever achieve it. Each new platform tends to push me back into a lot of refactoring to establish a pattern that \"feels right\". And there's always a new platform, and in today's polyglot world you need to track a few."

Unfortunately the insights gained through that research are rarely disseminated to the masses of developers doing implementation.

Actually I think what you describe there is something that I wish I would see more of. Mentorship among developers, achieving insights, not handing down plans for crystal castles but expanding knowledge together. While there is risk in tying research to commercial endeavours, it's a useful arrangement IMHO. On our teams in the past we've tempered youthful enthusiasm with experienced mentors to great effect. I think often insight and learning is incorrectly perceived as waste. Sometimes it is, but it doesn't have to be.

It does, however, require a commercial endeavour to look beyond immediate returns, while retaining the longevity to reap them, which can be challenging."

@Niels I'm unsure how to do so concisely, it has been a struggle sometimes to draw the distinction, but my business leverages certain tax credits that are more available to us while we work more on the periphery of technologies. Think about a new technology like Facebook's React. While the core science is not new, our education system fails to impart the knowledge of that science to recent generations of developers. We find ourselves often re-gaining lost insights as we digest new technologies and evaluate their implications in our approach to known problem domains. This concept is explored nicely in the recent Ruby Rogues episode interviewing Dave Thomas (PragDave) on limerence. We're not talking about the shifting syntax of similar programming languages, we're talking about the shifting community understanding of the interplay of functional and imperative programming, good practices for eventing models, etc. The experience of the developer determines whether in their code they aimlessly inflict the whim of stackoverflow, whether they glean some insight from comparative examples and their own approach, and whether they can encapsulate that insight and embody it in the code they build - often over iterations as they explore the problem domain and their tools at hand. They do not walk into this with prior knowledge, they are ill-prepared (not their fault, it's ours). Our field seems locked in this cycle of losing our insights of the past 60 years and regaining them often painfully and accidentally."

Technical practices around test-driven design tend to favour simpler designs. I like Liz Keogh's \"pass the salt\" story here. Developers can tend to complicate design for perceived future benefit that may never materialize. So TDD does not necessarily add costs, in fact can truly lower costs, when used in a disciplined fashion. Of course you don't need to use TDD explicitly if you simply apply the disciplines it teaches / enforces outside that context, but TDD is a great way to teach that as a skill."

Experimental development framing gives you the freedom to explore better structure within a given context. It feels like our discussion here is floating around \"D\" development is an activity that elicits no or little insight, whereas I view \"ED\" as \"D\" + significant gained insight. D can be commoditized, ED cannot. D is more deterministic than ED. A holistic view of value weights the value of insight against the value of output, as insight improves velocity by simplifying a context through better knowledge/abstraction."

That's not agile :) Software development is both the R and the D, given the pace of change in the industry, the way developers communicate (or don't). You tend to Learn, Research, Develop all at the same time. Learn a new API. Research how to accomplish what you want within it. Develop it. I like to separate the Learn / Research into spikes outside of \"production time\", so production time tends to end up misaligned with calendar time, where often they are conflated at different levels.

You look for patterns, try and find boundaries, intrinsic dependencies in the code. Even in this case, though, you can use tests to begin to define boundaries in a messy code-base. If all the code is imperative, it helps you tease out functional or at least testable pieces as you go. This is usually the approach I bring to folks, start with a characterization test and tease out some details as you come to an understanding of the system. Over time, you can end up in the same place at least with portions of the system that you foster forward instead of rewrite. BDUF implies you can predict the future, and I have little faith in that. I have faith in a steady stream of small victories, sometimes very very small, but victories nonetheless. Your team must own the code, not the other way around."

It is easy to see, and obvious to most that the tests depend on the code. Without the code, the tests can't run. However, what ends up being intrinsic in the code is how the tests have influenced its shape, the approach the developer took to writing it because they liked the aesthetic of the test they wrote. When you grok TDD, you realize that the code could never have existed without the tests that helped shape it. So to say that there is lesser meaning in the tests I believe is backwards. There is more meaning in the tests. They are as important as the requirements, without which the code would have no purpose."

I find bundler does a great job keeping your production gemset clean.

However, all gems that compile native library bindings (like RMagick to ImageMagick or Nokogiri to libxml2/libxslt) will have version dependencies on their underlying libraries. RVM does not solve this problem, and this will be the number one problem you face on a Linux distro built for long-term support (and providing that stable / supportable environment by holding back potentially disruptive version updates to libraries).

The Ruby community is very fast-moving, between versions of gems you'll often find  changes to their native library requirements."
2011-08-10 10:36:47,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3AgroupPost%3A22413-63997189,"You will find that Ruby gems will track newer native libraries then any commercially supported Linux OS provides (including Ubuntu LTS). ie. the RMagick gem. If you want the best experience, you want to be using Chef or Puppet to automate build-up of your hosting systems from faster-moving baselines like Ubuntu or Gentoo, or go to a commercial platform service such as Heroku or EngineYard.

If you simply try to apply traditional systems administration practices to your hosting environment, you will be frustrated by rebuilds and issues moving between base OS versions (ie. if you track Ubuntu server, going from 10.04 to 10.10 to 11.04 etc). Gentoo can be easier, but tends to be less well understood by the available talent pool of system administrators.

A nicely crafted Chef recipe will automate building a server from scratch with consistent base requirements and keep you from having a \"vested interest\" in managing a single server instance in the wild. In today's climate, changing servers should be a trivial exercise."

I run a software development company, Three Wise Men ([http://threewisemen.ca|leo://plh/http%3A*3*3threewisemen%2Eca/CZta?_t=tracking_disc]), based in Oshawa, where we have a small but extraordinary 10-person team.. Our customers range from large to startup, and our focus is on finely crafted systems for mobile, web and desktop.

With platforms like Facebook and Twitter, socially connected software opens up a lot of really interesting opportunities for business. They drive active engagement of your audience, rather than the classic passive Internet model (build, SEO, and hope they come).

By finely crafted we mean applications that integrate tightly and natively with social and mobile platforms. Rather than a web page that displays on a mobile device, our focus is on native applications that tightly integrate with device features like the cameras, accelerometers, GPS, telephony, and 3D graphics. Natively tied to social channels like the Facebook social graph - friends, likes, news streams, photos, videos, etc.

Our most successful clients come to us with an idea, a willingness to explore, and a solid understanding of who their customers are. Check out our most recent large scale business-to-consumer undertaking, a great application for golfers that deeply leverages the Facebook platform - [http://www.umegolf.com|leo://plh/http%3A*3*3www%2Eumegolf%2Ecom/Nmjl?_t=tracking_disc]"
