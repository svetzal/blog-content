## Trans Advocate

### Activating Tags
`advocacy`, `diversity`, `inclusion`, `lgbtq`, `trans`, `personal`

### Tagline
Cancer survivor, trans woman, and community builder who co-founded Gender Journeys programs to support trans folks and families across Ontario.

### Short Bio
Stacey Vetzal is a trans woman, cancer survivor, and advocate who believes that the best things she's ever done, she did because she didn't know she couldn't. After surviving a rare cancer in 2008 stripped away her paralyzing fear of transition, the support she received from the Toronto trans community and PFLAG Durham inspired her and her wife Sharon to give back. Together with community volunteers and healthcare professionals, they built and launched Gender Journeys programs in Durham Region and beyond—supporting trans folks, youth, caregivers, and partners. Stacey served as Vice President of PFLAG Durham Region from 2012-2015 and continues her advocacy work today.

### Long Bio
"People will always tell you that you can't. Do it anyways. Make mistakes for a living. Learn how you can. The best things I've ever done, I did because I didn't know I couldn't."

Born to a working-class family in Oshawa, Ontario, Stacey was a tech geek from the start. Assigned male at birth, she was encouraged to pursue science and electronics, got her first computer at the age of 13, and hasn't let go of it since. Her obsession with tech fueled her as a serial entrepreneur, but it was surviving a rare and brutal cancer in 2008 that stripped away her paralyzing fear of transition and changed the trajectory of her life.

The amazing support Stacey received from the Toronto trans community and PFLAG in Durham Region inspired her and her wife Sharon to give back. Working alongside other community volunteers and professionals in the healthcare community, they built and launched Gender Journeys programs in Durham Region and beyond—comprehensive support for trans folks, youth, caregivers, and partners navigating gender transition. Stacey served as Vice President of PFLAG Durham Region from 2012-2015 and was a guest lecturer at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology in Social Justice and Diversity. She also worked part-time with the Canadian Mental Health Association as an Education and Peer Support Worker, developing sensitivity training and facilitating peer support groups. Her message is simple: trans people are your children, your parents, your siblings, your friends. When we stop seeing trans folks as "other," transphobia loses its power. Stacey now lives with Sharon—her wife of 30 years and the real hero of her story—in a log cabin in the middle of the woods in Wilberforce, Ontario.

## Technical Leader

### Activating Tags
`ai`, `machine-learning`, `architecture`, `engineering`, `developer`, `coding`, `software-development`

### Tagline
Engineering leader with 45 years coding, now building agentic AI automation to help developers work more effectively at scale.

### Short Bio
Stacey Vetzal is an engineering leader with 45 years of software development experience who brings deep technical credibility and over two decades of coaching experience to engineering leadership. She founded Mojility in 2002 on the idea that building software is a humanist endeavour, and has coached development teams at organizations including Rogers, Sherwin Williams, Sallie Mae, and RBC. Currently at RBC as Director of Emergent Software Development, she's building and deploying agentic AI automation to help developers work more effectively at scale, and training teams on how to integrate generative AI into real-world delivery workflows. She codes every day and maintains that to lead developers well, you need to understand their craft from the inside out.

### Long Bio
Stacey Vetzal brings 45 years of hands-on software development experience to her work as an engineering leader. Starting with her first computer at age 13—a Tandy CoCo that still works and anchors her retro-computing collection—she has written production code in over a dozen programming languages, from Ruby and Java to Python, JavaScript, C++, and C#. Her technical depth spans everything from mobile development on iOS and Android, to web frameworks, database design, network architecture, and cloud platforms including AWS and Azure.

In 2002, Stacey founded Mojility, a software consultancy built on the belief that building software is a humanist endeavour, not a technological one. She grew the practice to 10 staff and $800K annual revenue, designed apprenticeship and internship programs with exceptional retention, and delivered solutions for clients including Rogers Communications (saving $3M in the first six months on one project), large-scale manufacturers, and numerous startups. From 2015–2021, she founded and led Coding Culture, a coaching practice focused on healthy software development culture—the idea that teams perform best when technical excellence and human systems evolve together.

At RBC, Stacey built and led the Digital Agile Coaching Practice, growing it to 22 coaches supporting 10 business areas. More recently, as Director of Emergent Software Development, she's moved closer to engineering again—building and deploying agentic AI automation to help developers work more effectively at scale, and training teams on how to integrate generative AI into real-world delivery workflows. She's watched the software industry reinvent itself—desktop, web, mobile, cloud—and believes AI is reshaping how we think about code, design, and collaboration. This might be the biggest shift yet.

Stacey's technical practices expertise includes test-driven development, acceptance test-driven development, behaviour-driven development, continuous integration and deployment, emergent design and architecture, and strategies for recovering from legacy code. She holds a rare ability to interface with C-level executives and developers alike, seeking alignment on goals and processes. Stacey codes every day and leads by example—because to lead developers well, you need to understand their craft from the inside out. She lives with her wife Sharon in a log cabin in rural Ontario.

## Business Owner

### Activating Tags
`business`, `entrepreneurship`, `consulting`, `leadership`, `management`

### Tagline
Serial entrepreneur who founded a worker-cooperative software consultancy because she couldn't reconcile corporate values with human ones.

### Short Bio
Stacey Vetzal has been running software businesses since 2002, when she founded Three Wise Men Inc. (later Mojility). Over 12 years she built a consultancy known for stable, loyal teams and a culture that treated developers as people rather than commodities. But she kept hitting the same friction: the values of a corporation—hierarchical, profit-focused, maximizing shareholder wealth—didn't match her own. So she co-founded The Commons Cooperative, a not-for-profit worker's cooperative, to align structure with values. For Stacey, business isn't about extracting value from people; it's about building something together, with shared purpose, for customers who are also people.

### Long Bio
Stacey Vetzal has spent over two decades running software businesses, and the journey has been as much about values as it has about code.

In 2002, she founded Three Wise Men Inc. (later renamed Mojility Inc.), a software consultancy that grew to 10 staff and $800K in annual revenue. She built apprenticeship and internship programs with exceptional retention rates, and delivered solutions for clients ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies including Rogers Communications, Sherwin Williams, Sallie Mae, and RBC. But running a corporation meant navigating an uncomfortable truth: when business is down, the CEO's job is to maximize shareholder value—which often means shedding staff to restore profitability.

For Stacey, that friction never went away. She invested deeply in her people, professionally and emotionally. She argued constantly that developers are not commodities to be bought and sold on the market. Yet the legal structure of a corporation demanded decisions that felt at odds with those convictions.

That tension led her to co-found The Commons Cooperative, a not-for-profit worker's cooperative focused on software development services. The difference wasn't just structural—it was philosophical. The values of a corporation are hierarchical and profit-focused. The values of a cooperative are democratic equality, sharing, and taking care of the community. At The Commons, every worker was aligned—not just doing a job for a paycheque, but working together toward a common cause, for customers who were also people.

From 2015–2021, Stacey founded and led Coding Culture, a coaching practice built on the principle that healthy software development culture—where technical excellence and human systems evolve together—is what allows teams to perform at their best. Throughout all of it, she has maintained that software development is a social endeavour. The best businesses she's built have had that truth in their bones.

Stacey lives with her wife Sharon in a log cabin in rural Ontario.

## Usage Notes

When writing a new post:
1. Identify the primary tags for the content
2. Use the tag mapping to determine which persona(s) are activated
3. Let that persona's voice, themes, and perspective influence the writing
4. For posts spanning multiple personas (e.g., `agile` + `business`), blend the perspectives but let the dominant tag's persona lead

When multiple personas could apply, consider:
- **Technical Leader** for deep technical content, code, architecture, AI
- **Agile Coach** for team dynamics, process, human systems in software
- **Business Owner** for entrepreneurship, consulting, organizational structure
- **Trans Advocate** for personal stories, advocacy, diversity and inclusion
