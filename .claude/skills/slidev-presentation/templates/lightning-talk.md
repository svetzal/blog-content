# [PUNCHY TITLE]

[One-line subtitle — the thesis in 10 words or fewer]

<!--
30 seconds. State your name, the topic, and why it matters.
No preamble — you have 5 minutes total.
-->

# [THE PROBLEM IN ONE SENTENCE]

<!--
30 seconds. Name the pain. Be specific and vivid.
"We've all been here..." — make them nod.
-->

---

## The Context

[One image, diagram, or 3-bullet summary that sets the scene]

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Current State] -->|Problem| B[Pain Point]
```

<!--
45 seconds. Just enough context for the solution to make sense.
Don't over-explain — trust your audience.
-->

# [THE KEY INSIGHT]

<!--
30 seconds. This is the core of the talk.
One sentence. Let it land. Pause.
-->

## Evidence

<v-clicks>

- [Proof point 1 — data, example, or experience]
- [Proof point 2]
- [Proof point 3]

</v-clicks>

<!--
45 seconds. Three quick pieces of evidence.
Each one should be a complete thought in under 10 words.
-->

---

## What This Means

<v-clicks>

- [Implication 1]
- [Implication 2]

</v-clicks>

<!--
30 seconds. So what? Why should anyone change behavior because of this?

# [CALL TO ACTION]

[One specific thing the audience should do differently]

<!--
30 seconds. Be concrete: "Next time you [X], try [Y] instead."
End with energy. Don't trail off.

## Lightning Talk Rules

1. **No more than 10 slides** — fewer is better
2. **No slide with more than 3 bullet points**
3. **No code block longer than 8 lines**
4. **Every slide earns its place** — if you can cut it, cut it
5. **Practice with a timer** — 5 minutes goes fast
