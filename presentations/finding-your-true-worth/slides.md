# Finding Your True Worth

Your value isn't in typing code — it's in what you know

<!--
Fair warning: I'm going to ask you to think about something uncomfortable today. Your worth. Not your salary, not your GitHub commit graph — your actual worth as a knowledge worker. Five minutes. Let's go.

# "From far enough away, all a developer does is type code."

<!--
I say this a lot. From far enough away, all a developer does is type code. And here's the thing — it's not just developers. From far enough away, all a surgeon does is cut people. All a lawyer does is argue. All a teacher does is talk. When you zoom out far enough, every profession looks like its most visible, most mechanical activity. And that's exactly the lens that gets applied when someone's deciding what to automate — or who to replace.

## The Workshop Moment

I ran workshops on writing AGENTS.md files — onboarding documents for AI coding agents.

<v-clicks>

- One developer captured **years** of institutional knowledge in a few paragraphs
- Another articulated patterns so deeply internalized she'd **never spoken them aloud**
- They didn't realize how much they knew — until they tried to teach a machine

</v-clicks>

<!--
This week I was running workshops where people wrote instruction files for AI agents. Plain text. "Here's where we put things, here's how we name things, here's what matters and why." And beautiful things happened. People started writing and they couldn't stop — because they were finally externalizing knowledge that had been locked in their heads for years. And the look on their faces when they realized the scope of what they knew? That was something.

# What the machines can't generate is what lives in *you*.

<!--
This is the core of it. LLMs are brilliant at pipeline glue — CI/CD scaffolding, CRUD apps, infrastructure templates. The distance between intent and output is short and predictable. But they can't know that your team tried microservices in 2019 and it was a disaster because of the org structure. They can't know Janet in accounting depends on that weird billing edge case. That's not in the code. That's in you.

## The Real Risk

<v-clicks>

- Not that AI replaces developers
- That we *accept the view from far away* as the truth
- That we optimize for keystrokes, measure in lines, and watch institutional memory evaporate

</v-clicks>

<!--
The danger isn't the machine. The danger is that we buy into the far-away view. That we accept "all a developer does is type code" as the whole story. Because if you believe that, you'll act accordingly. You'll outsource everything to the model and wonder why your systems grow brittle. I've watched this happen before — every time we treat knowledge workers as interchangeable units of output, we pay for it later. The cost just shows up somewhere else.

## The Durable Advantage

<v-clicks>

- Architecture and socio-technical coordination
- Understanding the humans in the system
- Making judgment calls that require the full story

</v-clicks>

<!--
Grady Booch talks about the winners in this transition — the ones who move up to architecture, risk management, designing systems that endure. That's not about being smarter than AI. It's about being present in ways AI can't be. Holding the context. Knowing the full story. Is that an opportunity? I think it might be the biggest one we've got.

# Write it down. Prove it to yourself.

Try explaining how your system *actually works* — and watch how much you know that you didn't know you knew.

<!--
So here's what I want you to do. Write an AGENTS.md. Or an onboarding document. Or just try to explain, in plain language, how your system actually works and why it works that way. That knowledge came from years of decisions, mistakes, 2 AM debugging sessions, and quiet observations. It's the sediment of experience. And right now, it's more valuable than ever. Go prove it to yourself.

# Thank You

<!--
From far enough away, all a developer does is type code. But you're not far away. You're right here. And you know better. That's your true worth — and it's not going anywhere, unless you let someone convince you it doesn't exist.
