  "ContentDescription": "A mostly dark, near-black image. In the bottom-right corner, a slightly larger fragment of the golden constellation network extends into frame — perhaps 10-15 connected nodes with luminous threads, reaching a bit further toward the center than variant 1 but still confined to the bottom-right quadrant. A few very faint, almost ghostly thread lines trail further into the darkness. The rest is deep midnight void.",

      "All nodes connected — no isolated elements",

  "CompositionNotes": "Similar to variant 1 but with a bit more network visible — the golden cluster extends further from the corner and has more nodes. Still very much a background image. The trailing ghost threads into darkness are key — they hint at the vast network beyond the visible portion. White text must remain readable over the majority of the frame."
