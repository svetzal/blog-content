  "ContentDescription": "An abstract celestial map of interconnected knowledge — hundreds of glowing amber and gold nodes connected by delicate luminous threads against a deep midnight blue-black void. The network is dense and intricate at the edges of the frame, thinning toward the center to leave breathing room. The pattern suggests both a star atlas and a neural network — something vast, beautiful, and deeply interconnected. The threads pulse with warm light, as if alive with thought. The overall feeling is of gazing into something immense and quietly magnificent.",

    "Rendering": "Detailed digital illustration with fine luminous linework, atmospheric depth, editorial quality",
    "Lighting": {
      "Type": "Self-luminous elements against deep darkness — nodes and threads emit their own warm glow",

  "Situation": {
    "Name": "The Knowledge Constellation",
    "Setting": "Abstract void — no ground, no horizon, just deep space filled with an intricate luminous network",
    "Camera": "Wide, slightly pulled back, gazing into the network from a comfortable distance",
    "Props": {
      "Conceptual": [
        {
          "Name": "Knowledge nodes",
          "Description": "Glowing amber-gold orbs of varying sizes — larger nodes represent deep expertise, smaller ones represent supporting details and connections",
          "Application": "Distributed across the frame, denser at edges, sparser in center",
          "SymbolicMeaning": "Individual pieces of knowledge and experience accumulated over a career"
        },
        {
          "Name": "Connection threads",
          "Description": "Fine luminous golden lines connecting every node to its neighbors, forming an organic web pattern — not a rigid grid but a natural, grown topology",
          "Application": "Linking all nodes together into a continuous living network",
          "SymbolicMeaning": "The relationships between ideas, the way experience connects disparate knowledge into wisdom"
        }
      ]
    },
    "KeyDetails": [
      "Every node must be connected — no isolated elements, the network is one continuous whole",
      "The threads should feel organic and slightly curved, not straight mechanical lines",
      "The center should be relatively open with sparser, more distant nodes visible through subtle depth blur",
      "The overall pattern should feel like it extends far beyond the frame edges — this is just a window into something immense"

  "CompositionNotes": "This is NOT a literal scene — it's pure abstract visualization. Think of it as a beautiful data portrait of everything a practitioner knows. The center must stay open enough for white title text. The network should feel warm, alive, and awe-inspiring — not cold or clinical. The organic curve of the connection lines is critical: this is grown knowledge, not engineered data."
