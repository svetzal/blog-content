  "ContentDescription": "A mostly dark, near-black image. In the bottom-right corner, a small cluster of the golden constellation network peeks into frame — a few warm amber-gold nodes connected by fine luminous threads, fading quickly into darkness. The network occupies roughly the bottom-right 20% of the frame. The rest of the image is deep midnight blue-black with perhaps the faintest hint of scattered gold dust trailing away from the cluster. Extremely subdued — this is a background, not a focal image.",

    "KeyDetails": [
      "The vast majority of the image must be dark — this is a text background",
      "The network fragment should feel like part of the larger cover network, just a corner glimpse",
      "Nodes must be connected by threads — no isolated elements",
      "The gold glow should fade gently into the darkness, not cut off sharply"

  "CompositionNotes": "This must be extremely subdued. The image is 80%+ pure dark void. The golden network fragment in the bottom-right corner is the only visual element, and it should be modest — a few connected nodes with warm glow that fades into nothing. White text must be perfectly readable over most of this image."
