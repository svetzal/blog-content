title: The Bionic Developer

This post has moved, I have renamed it.

I've been using the word "bionic" for a few years now as an adjective describing the evolution of various roles in software development as "Generative AI" has come on the scene. As always, I struggle for words. Bionic? Augmented? Amplified?

The shift is perhaps bigger and more fundamental than an adjective, though, so I'm going to stop using one for a while, and see how it goes.
